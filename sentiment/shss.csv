1,"At the first stage of the class ,he would introduce some basics stuff about photography and how to use different functions about camera. Then we will practice during the class outside the classroom.  After we handed in our homework (5 photos we took during field trips), we had to share to everyone. Though it is not serious presentation that we just had to speak on our seats, it made the class boring! Moreover, the instructor allowed people to speak in Cantonese. Therefore you won't understand what they are talking about.He is a nice photographer who would answer your questions patiently. Though sometimes he would speak in Cantonese to make locals understand easily, you can just raise your and say you don't understand. He would explain in English for you.The class takes shape much like a generic drama class, with a focus on practically trying out stuff. As it is just a 1 credit course, it just briefly touches upon a lot of ideas about drama an stage movement but doesn't explore them in any depth."
2,"Attendance is pretty much mandatory and ties directly to your grade.Excellent. She has a very hands on approach to teaching the class, and really promotes interaction between classmates. With the casual atmosphere maintained in class, it feels like you are just hanging out with friends rather than taking a course.A few notes in the LMES that helped give a structure to the practical http://learning.To quote, ""the stories should follow a clearly defined structure from (inception and cause) to the (climax and underlying message)"""
3,"Every class covered a new theme and was more hands-on and interactive than theoretical. It focused on creativity, body language, facial expressions and on-the-feet thinking.Was a wonderful experience. She was expressive and elaborate in explanations. Two extra lessons were organised for further practice. Everyone was given personal attention and feedback which went a long way in self improvement.The first two classes are introduction to some types of puppet, she only READ the ppt. The rest of the classes are totally useless, we just did our own paper cutting work. Don't expect to learn anything, you already know everything from your commonsense. The final showing is a shadow puppet performance with the script of Alice in Wonderland(the teacher decided the script). It was so boring.The instructor doesnt know how to manage time. Also, no useful feedbacks were given to students. We just did our own thing during every class.Basic Graphic Design principles."
4,"Usage of points, lines, shapes, colours etc"
5,"Elements of contrast, focus, repetition & spacing."
6,Small introduction to typography and layout design.
7,"Final project to implement all that you've learned into a poster design for a campaign (you'll need to present your initial idea, progress presentation, make the poster itself, submit a group project report and record all you've done in a logbook)"
8,"Also includes software workshop on Photoshop and Illustrator, not compulsory if you already know them."
9,"There is also a lesson where a guest speaker, who is himself a graphic designer, came and shared his experience in working in the field, giving us a glimpse of how graphic design works in real life.Alice is a very nice tutor. Her tone is comfortable and at the same time encouraging to students."
10,She is very experienced in the field of Design Education and has been affiliated to HKPU Design School for quite some time.
11,"Since the class is small, she is always willing to give us useful comments on our draft designs. Some may find it critical and nitpicking, but in the field of Design, taking critics is a major part of your job, so get used to it.I entered this course because I thought I would have been able to learn more computer-related design skills such as Adobe Photoshop and other design tools. Surprisingly, it was mostly about theories in graphic design and the only time we got to learn design programs (Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator) were in 3 supplementary workshops after the classes. So if you are looking for a class to learn more about design programs, this probably isn't the course for you.Alice overall is an okay instructor, but be prepared to jot down notes in this class, because her slides are picture-heavy and thus she says she cannot give it to us due to the pictures' copyrights."
12,Personally I feel she's a little forceful on opinions when this is supposed to be a more 'creative' class and that she might be prejudiced to those who can draw reasonably well. She does tend to miss people out during discussions and end discussions so it's probably better to be more proactive in discussions as it seems to affect class participation grades greatly.The prof is very nice and interactive.
13,She will do a demo in class one time for each topics and tell u the technique used in painting and coloring briefly. However u have to practice a lot to copy her technique.
14,When u are practicing in class she will come to guide and correct each person.  The prof also tries to help us improve the painting every time before submitting the work.
15,"Note that the teaching and all the materials are in Chinese.  This course might not be suitable for native english speakersThe instructor is nice and punctual. And she is enthusiastic with advising students with their work which I appreciate. It seems she also teaches Chinese painting II. The course is conducted in Cantonese so it's actually difficult for non-local students...All lectures are conducted in cantonese, which is really great. Instructor spent time with students for individual advising, telling each of us what to improve."
16,"But, sometimes she did talk boringly during demonstration making us fell alseep...The content is interesting, and very practical. This course is very different from other uni courses as there is nothing to memorise or recite. The class is similar to the art classes we had in high school.The instructor is very friendly and kind. She will be very willing to help if you are facing difficultiesThe Instructor introduces a good range of different styles of dance and questions that different boundaries of dance itself. The content is well researched, though the instructor is heavily influenced by American Works. It provides, what I feel is a good introduction to Contemporary dance."
17,"The Practical part of the lesson was more engaging. The instructor introduced motions of different levels of difficulty. There is also a lot of emphasis on strengthening the core and thigh muscles.The instructor is passionate and loves the art form. He has good knowledge and has researched adequately about Contemporary dance. He is aware that there are non-dancers who take the course and makes sure that he introduces a wide range of motions and exercises to strengthen core.Content is interesting because they teach you about creativity, but there was no indication that the only ""art"" portion we'd learn about was film.I thought it'd be more interactive since it is an art class but the title is misleading because it seems to be lots of powerpoint lectures and lab book work on your own time. The lecturers are dry. They try to get the small class to participate but the same people half-heartedly volunteer.The course is about training your brain to be more creative. It is actually quite interesting and fun. Marketing student might find it quite useful.The teachers were from poluU as I remember. It could be very boring when they were showing a lot of art work in the powerpoint. However, it was quite relaxing when it comes to group activities. you might have to share your thoughts to the whole class in nearly every lesson but it was very casual. The class size is very small so you can easily be friends with others normally."
18,p.s. quite a lot of foreigners and exchange students took this course at that timeNot as experimental as I would have liked.
19,"Each class starts with some blind drawing and continuous line drawing to warm-up. Then the drawings you work on will be whatever idea the instructor has for you to try. The whole idea is just to let you think/draw out of the box, nothing concrete is taught."
20,"I like experimenting in art on my own anyway so this course was slightly dull; I've seen the book the instructor was using for ideas in my local bookshop. If you've only been drawing specific things like realism or animes or just kind of unexperimental, then this course will be more challenging and different."
21,"For our semester we did greyscale pixel drawing, motion drawing, drawing a figure using shapes etc. The instructor is quite free though, not requiring us to follow the original idea exactly (that would kind of ruin the point).Your typical art teacher. She's very free and will tell you not to force yourself to do something. Will flexibly change the content and pacing according to the class."
22,"Best part of the teaching is that she still made me realise that there is more to explore, that I can push the boundaries more, but all that came from one-to-one talks and not the class. Did I mention the class was a bit dull for me?"
23,"So yeah, typical art teacher.mainly about the basic technique of Chinese painting"
24,the background and history of the Chinese painting somehow is also included
25,"the skills taught have color mix, how to draw and paint different flowers, how to draw a cockquite polite and friendly"
26,patient enough to provide adequate advice to let us know how to improve
27,"each time when we start a new topic, she would firstly demonstrate to show us the techniques and the things we need to pay attention"
28,overall is satisfactoryClass was quite small and the instructor was nice. I really enjoyed the course.
29,"Class was very relaxed without strict regulations. My class was at 9 am but most of the people came in 5~10mins late. There was one major artwork exhibition, and it was fun doing it.We don't actually get to learn anything (skills), but we got to try a new way of drawing such as drawing without looking, drawing with one single line ...etc and it was very interesting.the course covered around 160 years of fashion industry in 1 month, and it was expected that it was not going to be something in great detail, however, personally speaking, I think it is good enough for non-fashion background students to study the characteristic of each era and famous designers. Also, the course provided chances to practice sewing techniques .The lecture were mainly divided in to 2 parts, 40-45 mins theory session, and remaining 1.5 hours is for practical skill learning of how to sew. There was a TA and she gave me good and practical advice on techniques.Lectures are on Fashion History. Reading the textbook, which is available at the library provides just a little more detail than delivered in class. The lectures are not difficult or boring at all. There are only few points to remember for each era, such as silhouette, fabric choice, patterns, which comes easy if you're interested in vintage fashion and the current trend. However, I did came in the course expecting a bit more tailoring skills to be taught. We were taught to make simple projects like a skirt or a dress, but we were only taught techniques and not how to design and produce from scratch. I was quite disappointed there wasn't more time for learning how to draw a pattern, properties of different fabrics, or color theory.Silvio is a fun teacher and did a great job delivering his passion for fashion and experience in the industry. A seamstress was responsible for the practical exercises. She was experienced and patient.The course has two parts: dancing part and theory part"
30,"Tutor will base on your ability to arrange an array of routines, including the classical  Chinese dance and folk dance. As most of my classmates have learnt Chinese dance before, the difficulty and standard would then become higher which may become hard to some beginners."
31,"For theory part, students only need to jot down the notes and reflection in each lesson and submit a journal at the end of the course.Tutor is patient to teach each students and would give some advices. She aims to let students enjoy to experience the Chinese dance and thus focuses more on this part. She would briefly talk about the theory part at the end of each lesson in a relax way.One of the best course and surely the most interesting course I have taken in HKUST. Very different from any other course. Cover different singing techniques and body gestures, staging and performance. But the accapella part is removed due to limit of time. In the second half, requires much time to watch others' performance instead of individual teaching.The instructor can tackle each person's weak point and provide guidance on how to improve them. Very useful if you really want to improve singing in this course. Patrick is nice and makes you feel confident when performing.Teacher name: patrick. Good. The lesson atmosphere is good ad relaxing as the classmates are quite fun, a lot of jokes.Covered most of the European historic events from the 14th century to Europe today. Most of the contents are given in ppt slides, little notes needed to be jotted in lectures."
32,One summary sheet with key terms is provided in each lecture for easier understanding.
33,"But you still need a good level of English to cope with a large number of terms.Prof. is good. He is passionate in this subject. He explains the content well. So, attending lectures definitely helps your understanding. The only shortcoming is that you need time to familiarize with his accent. (He is an Italian with a Hong Kongese wife) Though, his speaking pace is quite slow (also a bit boring sometimes), you can follow the content most of the time.The content was very interesting, take the time to think about the areas he delves into and look and research into what it is like today.Excellent and interactive teaching, and Prof Wu didn't care your pronunciation of PTH. He was patient and kind to all of his students.The grading was straightforward, if you pay attention to his lectures it will be clear how to formulate your arguments to find success in this class.Not much workload, 1 mid term and 1 final essay, 1 project,1 small essay. Final essay's title choose your own title for your essay.Lectures cover different topics of Chinese and Western cultures and values."
34,"Contents are quite interesting and are useful for the essay. Many reading materials but not necessary to read it.Dr. Nam is nice and likes joking. He has arranged some optional lectures for students who want to know more and counsel for their essay. However I skipped many lessons and no more comment on teaching.The content is interesting. Many PRS but not count in grading. Teachers are very very very nice!!!Teachers are very very very nice! Dr. Nam will offer some optional cantonese and putonghua tutorials for students who do not understand the content in lesson. Though the essay topics are quite difficult, Dr. Nam is so generous that he is always willing to give us directions and ideas.Lecture contents cover different topics and not badly design - from morality to destiny. Contents are interesting for people who love to think about these abstract stuffs. But sometimes topics are quite mixed together and hard to follow.Very bad english... Very hard to understand even when I am from Hong Kong too... I feel sorry for the internationals in the lecture hall cause I don't think they even get half of what the professor says in lecture... Professor always tries to be funny but failed... But he teaches very well out of lecture when he held extra tutorial sessions.Just follow the instruction of the course."
35,Learning concepts about the Chinese and Western philosophy.
36,Not hard for local/mainland student to understand.Prof. Nam is a really good professor.
37,"As a local student, it is easy to understand his jokes and slangs."
38,He is really responsible. He even arranged optional review classes in both Cantonese and Mandarin.
39,"Basically, attend these optional classes, you may catch up the content in the lectures.Lectures cover wide range of Chinese and Western culture and values including Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Mohism, Confucianism, Daoism, destiny and well-beings. Majority of the topics will be tested on quizzes and only one concept out of Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Mohism, Confucianism is required to appear in your essay and you can find some useful points on Dr Nam's recommended readings.Dr Nam managed to deliver his powerpoint slides with some real-life examples which helps me understand some difficult terms and theories. However, his English has a large room for improvement which you need extra attention on his class since some questions in the quiz will be disclosed on lectures. Dr Susanna Ho and Dr Nam both spent extra time for consultation on the 1000-word essay, which one should realize what they ask for and how one can improve from the draft essay. The teaching on lectures was a bit not understandable but both quizzes only test your memory of the exact wordings in the ppt. However, the teaching on the tutorial is essential for you to write the essay smoothly and attendance and some little practices on Canvas are required.This course is an introductory course for music composition, covers music from the Baroque period to the early 20th centry. You will learn different types of scales, technique to write polyphonic music, and the very important counterpoint."
40,This course is well structured. The progress of the course and the content of each lesson is clearly stated on a handout which will be given at the start of the semester.Professor Kaila is one of the best professors i have met in ust. He has showed great enthusiasm in teaching throughout the course. He will answer your questions seriously and help you in every possible way. He can also remember everyone's name in the class.
41,"During the lesson, he will always interact with you to ensure you understand what he just taught.basic music theory (less than Grade 8 level), including scales, chords, intervals, etc. Don't expect too much to learn if you have music background. On the contrary, you can learn a lot in a short period of time if you don't have any music background.The instructor is excellent in music but he is strict. You can hardly chat or make a noise in lessons, perhaps he is too sensitive to sound."
42,Tutorials are NOT helpful at all but attendance are required.The instructor teaches at a good pace that he gave some examples throughout his teaching. One lecture generally teaches one topic/ one complex subtopic.
43,"In tutorials, it is good that the TA sometimes urges some students to answer in order to know whether u understand. There are some harder listening exercise as the semester goes on. In the beginning, you may be required to distinguish major/ minor, duple/triple, but at the end you need to dictate a short melody played by TA (played by instructor in final exam). There are some exercises uploaded to canvas which is caring.Started with basic stuff of music theory to nearly grade 8 music theory level. Quite hard to catch up for ppl with no music background.Clear and organized. He is quite strict on attendence tho. Tutor is really nice!!Average grading, only that the mean is usually quite high (there are students who are really good....). Exam is really difficult for the listening part. You have differetiate 7th chords and do a melodic dictation.Quite heavy. Got hw every lesson, tutorial every week, concert review, composition exercise. Tutorial is quite useful but also demanding. A lot of ear training exercises.The content covered most of the ABRSM Grade 1-5  and few Grade 6-8 music theory."
44,"Mainly about pitches, key signatures, time signatures, scales, intervals, triads, seventh chords, modulation, cadences etc.The professor is passionate and use piano playing in assisting his teaching. He is very nice and willing to answer your questions after the lectures. He may use students' composition works to tell us what is good or bad."
45,"The tutorials are conducted by his TA, mainly focus on aural training (melodic dictation, rhythm dictation, distinguish the triads, chords and cadences) and point us the common mistakes in your homework. The training will help you to familiarize the exam aural part.Easy stuff, all about simple theories in ABRSM syllabus. You need to buy a book (either e-book or printed) for assignment. For course details, see attachment.Prof. Kaila:"
46,"I think Kaila is an excellent and experienced professor, with (comparatively) clearer English speaking, I can almost understand what he meant in lectures."
47,Some flaws. Kaila won't write down some key terms that are needed to understand.
48,He is very kind that likely to answer your question.
49,Galison Lau:
50,"In the tutorials, he explained many mistakes that found in our assignments, and try to illustrate to us what is the correct one."
51,"The main part of the tutorial is ear training. I think he did not show us the skills, only doing some exercises..."
52,"He is also likely to answer your question.Basic music theory, focusing on reading, writing and analytical listening."
53,Main focus:
54,"Writing skills: major and minor keys, intervals, chords, chord progressions and simple harmonic analysis"
55,Aural skills:
56,"recognizing chords and intervals, notating simple melodies and rhythms by ear, distinguishing major and minor, meters and textures"
57,The first half of the course (before midterm) is easier for those who have music theory grade 5.Average.
58,Using the textbook to assist your revision after lectures will be helpful in case you can't catch up with what the lecturer says.
59,"Tutorials are not too helpful though its aim is to train and consolidate your aural skills because not many practical and useful techniques are taught.People say that this course is dominated by people who have music background. I also have taken music theory exam level 5 in the past. I have knowledge of everything taught in the first half of the course. But the second half exceeds music theory exam level 5 and can become a bit difficult sometimes. Homework and exam are quite easy so losing 1 or 2 marks can really downgrade your course grade. But overall, for me, I feel the course curriculum is well designed for people who want to learn music and is very useful. You get to learn from scratch, learn music composition, and build up pretty good foundation.The lecturer is solemn for most of the times and do not allow people chat during the lecture. He will pick you to answer question if you do not pay attention. Also, attendance is taken for every lesson and tutorial. The tutor can remember everybody's face. It sounds pretty horrible but I found it not really harsh if you want to learn seriously.You know all content before midterm if you know grade 5 music theory. Content after midterm is a little bit difficult. They require you to be able to know the chord when the instructor plays it, and do melody dictation, though not difficult in fact.Nothing special. Not very interesting but not boring. Quite easy to understand if you have attended the lesson.Content is very simple. If you practice enough you can get good grade easily."
60,"Four lunch talks and two concerts are compulsory, but well... they are pretty lame, few good compositions.To be honest, I don't find the teaching helpful. But Prof is a fun guy. Use teoria, cuz music theory is about practicing :) There's raffling in class, so.. if you wish to use iprs set to take attendance, find someone to answer questions for you or you'll have one absence.The content covers from some basic concept such as note, rhythm, interval, scales, chords. And finally, help you to do some analysis on the composition then compose a short piece of a final project. All these seem easy to handle if you have a strong foundation of music theory."
61,"Some contents are more than so-called ""music theory"" but it is really cool to get access to basic composition skills and sight-singing."
62,"Tutorial will concentrate on listening practice since there's a 30 point listening test in the final exam.He's a graceful Finnish guy. I really like his improvised piano piece during the lecture. But it may be somewhat boring for those have a musical background.It is about basic western classical music theories, a bit harder than ABRSM Level 5 Theory Exam as identifying four sevenths cadences are required at final exam which is really difficult. Not recommend for those haven't taken any theory exams before if you hope for a good grade.The lecturer and tutor both teach well and they really can help you learn more and use the skills learnt in lectures and tutorials."
63,"Lecture is mostly about theories and tutorial is mostly about composition skills and identifying melodies and cadences.HUMA 2104 is an introduction to the basics of music theory, with an emphasis on"
64,"reading, writing, and analytical listening. Writing skills taught in the course include pitch"
65,"notation using treble and bass clefs, rhythmic notation, the construction of scales in major"
66,"and minor keys, intervals, chords, chord progressions, and simple harmonic analysis."
67,Aural skills taught in the class and practiced in tutorials include recognizing chords and
68,"intervals, notating simple melodies and rhythms by ear, and distinguishing between"
69,"tonalities (major and minor), meters (duple and triple), and textures (homophonic and"
70,"polyphonic). The course culminates in a final project of composing a simple tonal piece.Instructor is interesting, for both lectures and tutorials."
71,Can't be late for class. Attendance is taken through PRS at the beginning of class sharply.
72,"It is required to buy a textbook cause homework are attached at the back of the book. The book cost ~HKD$400. Be prepare for this when taking this course,The content is said to be intended for non-music background but obviously 99% have good music theory background. Student needed to buy a textbook which is either online with restricted time or buy a hard copy. Learning from note, pitch, scale, chords, inversions and cadences. Students with music background should feel very easy but non-music background students should feel depressed. A progress learning of how to compose a short melody will be taught.The textbook is good to read and easy to understand for even a new learner. But the instructor is too boring. Even all the lessons are compulsory but the lesson is not worthy to take. Do think twice if you wanna use a course and attendance to learn this.- Lecture materials are quite boring if you have any music theory background"
73,- Prof. tries to make jokes but...
74,"- Major/minor, chords, Rhythm, Listening..."
75,- Chord listening and melody dictation part may be hard even if you have music background.- Needa buy an expensive textbook (pdf format) and the license only last for one semester.
76,- Tutorials and Lectures (Both cant skip)
77,- Requires self-learning
78,- You must follow the 'rules' of the professor
79,"- PRS once the lecture begins, never delayBasic music theory"
80,The content will be easy if you have some knowledge in music.
81,"Even if you don't, the textbook is well-written and very easy to understand. The final exam and midterm are almost the same as the assignments in the textbook, which are easy after reading the textbook.Classes are boring in my opinion."
82,"The professor is very strict about attendances and participation. He only gives you 1 minute and 30 seconds for PRS from the time that class starts and after that you're counted as late. Although he dislikes students not focusing on class, he only mentions it and doesn't record it to grade students based on such attitude."
83,"In tutorials the instructor asks some questions and students need to listen and sing as a group to review the contents. Tutorials are basically review of the lectures, but attendance is crucial.The content is interesting for those who studied a bit of music before and wants to know more about how to compose a song. It is less useful in the first half of semester but easy to understand. It gets more useful but difficult in the second half of semester.Teaching in CYT, the instructor is nice but the way he taught is not really suitable for people with no music background. i.e. He usually demonstrates the rhythme and other tones on the piano and picks people to answer random questions. Even though the content before mid-term is easy, the melodies and content became harder to understand and hear after the mid-term.The content was all about basic Grade 5 music theory which I have learnt before, so the content was easy to me.The teaching was fun as the professor demonstrated examples by playing the piano and playing recordings to us quite often. The lessons were relaxing.I have attended all lectures and only skipped one tutorial. Most of my assignments are above average. My mid-term was 102/104. I got an A for this course at the end. It was quite easy to get an A if you are a music enthusiasts.The workload was quite heavy. There were one assignment each week. You also have to attend a compulsory concert, write a concert report and do a composition at the end of the semester.All the basic theories from music notation, scales, intervals, chords to harmonies are covered throughout this course."
84,Attendance is required for every lecture and tutorial class.
85,"This course is an advantage for those who have prior music theory knowledge and background. But it is challenging if you have no any music knowledge at all.Teaching is good, in a sense that Kaila will explain the concepts in a very detailed and clear way and make sure you understand them. He sometimes will make fun/jokes in class so as to grab your attention."
86,I don't have a hard time catching up with the class because I have studied some basic music theory before. But it is still fine for everyone if you review the concepts after the class.
87,Also you will have to pay close attention to the instructor because he speaks quite fast.
88,"Kaila is passionate talking and teaching students off the class. Overall his teaching is good.The content is all about basic music theory , such as key signature , chords and so on . So , the course is suitable for those who have already study music theory."
89,"attendance : every lecture and tutorial lessonsThe teaching of the instructor is quite interesting and clear . But for those people who have not studied any music theory beforehand , it would be relatively hard for them to understand what instructor taking about in the lesson . But if we are willing to spend more time to do revision at home , it would be fine .Content covers Theory exams Trinity grades 1 and 2. Basic music notation, Scales, Intervals, Rhythm, Mater, Harmony, Chords. Its not very hard for someone who has some prior knowledge. Course can be challenging if you have no idea about these terms whatsoever.Teaching is pretty good. Very thorough will the material and super knowledgeable. Attendance is graded and has a fair weightage to the course grade so missing lectures and tutorials will affect your grade for sure.A lot of my friends missed lectures every now and then, as did I. (Hint, for our sem, he usually takes attendance twice in a row, then goes easy on us for a while) And even when I went, I never really gave the course my attention (apologies again). The professor basically drones on in the background while students sit and type at their computers. But Zhang min still enthusiastically carries on without a care in the world, and he really seems to be quite passionate about the material. However, if you're more accustomed to skipping classes and cramming before tests, at least have a friend to fill in your attendance for you (which itself requires a certain level of skill, since the TA counts how many students are sitting in a row, and hands out attendance slips accordingly...but she could always make a mistake, you never know;) and read the required reading. At least the first quarter of it. That will basically serve as your surrogate tutor.The course content are quite interesting."
90,It give you some different aspect to look at language.
91,"To remind you, this course is definitely not about literature but the analysis of language. It never matter if you are not good at literature at all."
92,Some tips for you:
93,"Understanding the concept of conceptual metaphor and metonymy are very important for all of your analysis throughout this course.  Try to work on (or just take a look with) those provided exercises to strengthen your understanding!Professor will explain all lecture materials in a very very detailed way! (but actually, as the lecture materials are quite easy to understand, you can read them by your own. so I seldom pay attention during lectures:p)This course is mainly focus on analysis of language, but not about literature. So if you are not good at literature, this is not a problem."
94,"Content : Metaphor, metonymy"
95,"The content is quite interesting, talk about the metaphor  in daily life.Professor is full of passion, yet sometimes it is quite boring."
96,I always read the notes by myself.It is about chinese and english metaphor.
97,"i think the content is not much, repeat the similar topic."
98,"The content is very simple, what u need to do is just reading all the examples and do all the exercises.The prof is very cute, he teaches with lots of body language and trys to make some gag."
99,"He gives lots of example and exercises to illustrate one statement, but due to too many examples, sometimes I get bored and play with my phone.The course encompasses a wide range of diverse topics such as literary metaphors, metaphors in everyday language, and metonymy.The teacher is good and well-prepared. I tried to listen carefully for the first few classes and I found it really interesting. He uses a lot of examples and graphs to make it more vivid. The one that impresses me most is LOVE IS A CONTAINER. However, if you are really not interested in this topic, the class will be more than boring to you. I saw many students fall asleep in class actually.¡ú_¡úMetaphors and metonymy! Analyze all kinds of metaphors. It sounds that every class it's about the same things and  theories so I felt bored. Dig into many commonly used phrases and sentences like ""falling in love"" and show that in this sentence, there's a metaphor which is LOVE IS A CONTAINER, to show that metaphors are commonly used as a conceptual tool to help people understand things.Vivid, always use actions or graphs to explain metaphors. Really excited every class and always laughing at his own jokes regardless of all the asleep students....The content is interesting. It may change your view towards the language you use everyday because after understanding the concepts you will discover that nearly every sentences we speak contains metaphors."
100,"It does not need good language skill, but having good English has a little bit advantage.The teaching is fine. But I dont really listen to the class because I was there only for attendance. I think I only attended less than half of the class."
101,"There are a lot of so-called required readings, though I only read one. These readings may not really help with your exams and your grade whatsoever.As suggested in the topic, it is about conceptual metaphors in both Chinese and English. Metonymy was also covered."
102,It is better for Chinese to take the course as many examples and exam questions were in Chinese. Most foreigners dropped the course after the first lesson.
103,"Do not expect it to be a language course. It is more like understanding the logic in the metaphors. So fluency in English or Chinese wouldn't help that much as long as you can read.The teaching pace is quite slow and the tone of the professor was really boring so I didn't pay much attention in class. I just went to class for attendance taking. But the professor taught the materials in great detail(according to my minimal attention paid), so it would help on some topics that are difficult to grasp."
104,The power point slides basically got everything needed. I just read through the slides before quiz and exam.This is the pre-reg course for GCS Year 1 student.
105,"This course is about the general history of China between the 1830s to 1940s, in terms of the social, political, economic and cultural perspective."

114,"The topic is for reference only as the schedule always lag behind and may not have time cover all the topics.For the lecture, there is no ppt provided but only lecture outline is given. You need to jot down what he is saying quickly as the content he has spoken is similar to the final exam question. The format of final exam is long essay questions."
115,There are four tutorial sessions and one question (similar to essay question) and the coverage of assigned reading will be provided to you in advance to think of. Each one  need to speak sth and discuss the question given. Every student will be appointed as a leader of discussion in at least one session of tutorial.This course is about modern Chinese history (1800s-1949).
116,"The professor covers some main historical events like the Opium war, the 1911 revolution as well as the living status of Chinese people in that period.Professor Ho's teaching style is no doubt unique: some may find it intriguing, while some others would easily fall asleep on his lecture. Unlike history teachers in high school who focus on memorizing historical events, he tends to teach us by giving statistics and some stories. This means that we would have to go through the textbook ourselves to have the basic concept and timeline of major events. But still, for those who are bored with high school history class and want to hear something different, Professor Ho's lecture might be a good choice.It's mandatory course for GCS students, and also a common core course, which covers modern Chinese history. However, if you are not interested or haven't learnt Chinese history before, I recommend you to take other courses instead. Also, if you are non-Chinese background student, you will easily get confused with all historical issues and other historical elements.To be honest, I cannot find any good parts of this professor. He sometimes speaks Cantonese in lecture that confuses non-canto speaking students, considering that it's common core course. He does not provide any PPT or notes that you might need to jot down or make voice records for all classes as you will miss out some important points that will appear on exam paper. I would say TAs were very helpful, and they were always willing to help students.Modern China period from Late Qing to Civil War. Readings are mediocre not too much workload. But make sure you are interested if you want to enjoy the readingsPoor teaching. Did not attend lessons after midterm. Useless. Lectures not useful to exam at all. Attendance not calculated.Quite good. I got A-, with all tutorials attended and actively participated, and 22/25 for midterm.Tutorials, midterm and final exam."
117,Tutorial - Not really satisfied with having tutorials out of class time. Required to study few texts beforehand and do in class discussion with peers regarding the text and guided discussion questions.
118,Midterm - 3 short questions and 1 essay question. Marked by TAs therefore quite lenient.
119,"Final - 5/6 short questions and 2 essay questions. Marked by professor. Did not receieve the grade for final essay but still fine if you studied the required readings well.This course covers from the decline of Qing dynasty to the establishment of Republic. There are lots of things to remember, but if you have general knowledge on world history, there shouldn't be lots of problem."
120,"I think if you don't like reading, you will have some hard time."
121,"Both mid-term and final are all essay-writing, which final took whole 3 hours of writing."
122,"There are tutorials you must attend every 2 weeks.Professor Ho speaks good English, but you really need to pay attention to understand what he is saying."
123,He does not covers all during his lecture. Reading will help you.the content around the chinese history from major event like opium war til the present modern chinaslightly boring
124,but the lecture do not need to take attendance
125,"do not have any IPRSjust fair grading, even the workload is not small"
126,"i dont really feel like it is a good grade courseneed to do one long essay around 2to3000 words in chinese or english which is optional, slightly hard for people who have never really come across with the chinese history subjects previously"
127,"only final exam and essayx1History of modern china (from 1830s, pre opium war to 1920s students' movements)"
128,Analysis from Prof. Ho is entirely different from the text required by Immanuel Hsu.Teaching of Prof. Ho is boring because of his flat voice. I don't know why he always blames others.
129,4 tutorial sessions conducted by TA are excellent. Concrete examples were given. Mr. Kent Yeung gave enough guidance for our term paper as well.The content itself is interesting once you get the flow.
130,It is important to follow up with assigned reading.Sometimes boring and sometimes fun.
131,"He does not use any ppt, and barely used LMES/Canvas, you only have your in-class notes and assigned reading to study with."
132,"Professor would explain events in detail, which helps to get the entire idea, so I suggest writing down somewhat detailed note.The content is very rich, with different areas of arts being taught. The details of statues, architectures were taught that has really widen my horizons.Prof. Fu has got great understanding and knowledge in arts. She is a nice person who is very helpful and patience to students. Her teaching is pretty good, yet you would have to pay great attention as she is quite soft-speaking.This course will cover Buddhist art, ceramics, pottery, and calligraphy etc., which provides sufficient knowledge as   a introductory level art course."
133,"Apart from taking regular classes, students would also need to attend collector talks and visit some off-campus Chinese art exhibitionsProfessor Fu is an extremely nice teacher (e.g. distributed snacks to students as she worried that some of them did not have breakfast ). She is definitely passionate in teaching as well as sharing the beautifulness of our world. She offers students the utmost freedom to explore and pursue their interest. For students who finish her course, she would continue sending the information of the latest Chinese art exhibitions.-This course is about the development of techniques n style of different art forms in China."
134,"-Topics include pottery, jade, architecture, Buddhist art, etc-Sweet n patient professor :)"
135,"-Extremely helpful TA > u can get loads of suggestions from him on the group project, including topic setting :)-Well, just do ur individual paper nicely, A range, haha"
136,"-Prof. do give high marks to most of the students, so, ya, the deviation bit narrow-individual paper:"

147,use cantonese to teach
148,"This course is designed to familiarize students with the major developments of Chinese philosophy in the traditional period. It will focus specifically on Confucianism, Mohism, Taoism, Legalism and Buddhism for the very reason that not only had these schools had exerted significant impacts on the formation of the Chinese mind in the past, but they will also continue to shape the Chinese outlook on life in the future.not very good ,really hard to understandingSudden quiz x4     30%"
149,Reflective essay    30%
150,Final exam             40%teach in cantonese
151,"professor encourage student to ask question, give their own opinion as well  as discuss in classYou are suggested to read the required materials and PowerPoint regularly. They contain a lot of Classical Chinese, so if you are not good at Chinese, you should pay more effort on it in order to understand the materials."
152,"PowerPoint contains 60-160 slides but I think the average is about 100 slides and most of them are about stories and proverbs of the philosopher and the philosophy (e.g. Taoism, Confucianism).Professor skipped many of the materials while they would be appeared in final exam (The syllabus is teaching one philosophy in one lecture but the progress is a little bit slow)."
153,He likes to engage student to discuss with each other in the lecture so the atmosphere is not that boring.
154,This course is taught in Cantonese so it fits local student.A course that outline the modern Chinese history from the Opium war to Cultural Revolution in China. Prof Hung started the Guangzhou trading system as a starter to explain the outbreak of the opium war.
155,"*Lecture and readings are in CANTONESEProf Hung is a charming old man, he has superb knowledge in chinese history. He never uses any visual aids for his lecture. He just uses his voice to capture your soul.The Content is all about different Chinese paintings in different dynasty. The professor will explain different chinese painting techniques and the style of the painters in putonghua. Since she has dimmed the light for us to see the paintings clearly, I have almost fell asleep in every class. If you like Chinese painting, this will definitely bring you some new knowledge.The professor is a really soft-spoken lady. Therefore, if your mandarin is not that good, you may have difficulties hearing what she is talking about. However, she is a very very nice lady, along with the Ta, she is very willing to give you the materials and also suggestions that you need for your group project. And she is very lenient on students.The course covered mostly logic, including some some traditional rules and theories in logic and modern logic. A few lectures covered rhetoric in the context of Mencius and some other Chinese philosopher.Professor tried to discuss with the whole class, explaining the ideas with the use of latest news and examples which are easy to understand. Professor and TAs are also very willing to answer questions both in class and after class.Most of the class is about logic (Aristotle) while at the very end of the course it is about Mencius."
156,Lots of reading are given. Some quizzes may include very few question on the reading.Teaching is clear.
157,"In some lessons, most of the time is student discussing or challenging the professor. It is quite confusing during that class."
158,Cantonese.I would say Prof Yip has passion and using Cantonese really helps our understanding of the materials.
159,"Nevertheless, much of class time was not lecturing - either letting people to ask questions, or talking about the news. So she only covered few materials throughout the semester.***Cantonese is the medium of the course***"
160,"Content involve Logic and Language, Syllogism, Modern Logic, Fallacies , Rhetoric and Background of Aristotle and Mencius"
161,---
162,"The concept of logic is not difficult to understand, but it is not easy to be applied on quiz.The course basically has Lecture only. The tutorial is optional but I recommend you to go since it is interesting."
163,"The Lecture is not boring at all ,and the instructor and TA are helpful. They are willing to answer student's question after lesson.Good teaching, clear and logical."
164,"Active class participation and the instructor is responsive to students' questions.Readings written by a few classical philosophers, professor brown usually only explains a few important topics/themes instead of going through the whole thing.I'd say he's a passionate teacher, but that doesn't mean he's a good one. Reading the whole thing directly from the powerpoint is one of the things he loves doing (AND THE THING I HATE MOST) though there's a thorough elaboration afterwards, it really irritates me a lot."
165,"He's really willing to answer any questions and encourages students to raise their hands during lectures, but honestly I don't think he's really able to answer most of them...sometimes he replies with stuff that has nothing to do with the question LOL"
166,"Usually the last 20 minutes are reserved for group discussions and he'll pick some groups to present their ideas, personally this section gives me more insights than the teaching.The content center around a few classical philosophical pieces including the Story of Gyges¡¯ Ring, Leviathan, Two Concepts of Liberty, A Critique of Ethical Egoism, story of the child falling into the well, I and Thou, Nicomachean Ethics, Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, 12 Angry Men, Arendt¡¯s Eichmann in Jerusalem, Civil Disobedience, On What We Can Not Do, Citizenfour.The teaching is extremely slow and repetitive. Very boring due to the endless repetition of trivial matters (like definitions). You would expect a philosophy course to be much more interesting than that. Very often just scratch the surface of the issues discussed. Nonsense grouping for a course without group project which prevent you from hearing more diverse views. Technically, you are better off to just self-study (unfortunately he took attendance every class)Rich content and quite a no. of famous and influential pieces are covered. There is also 7 attendance-taking pop quizzes throughout the semester. Should be fine as long as you attend and do the quizzes, the content doesn't really matter.The prof is very knowledgable in his area. He likes interacting and inviting students to share their ideas a lot in class especially. He is also very friendly and patient when answering questions.Readings:"
167,1. Gyses' Ring by Plato
168,2. Leviathan by Hobbes
169,3. A Critique on Ethical Egoism by Rachels
170,4. Story of a child falling into a well by Mencius (in English)

180,14. Civil Disobedience by Thoreau
181,15. Articles on Edward Snowden
182,Movies:
183,1. 12 Angry Men
184,"2. Citizen FourFor explaining the content of the readings, Brown usually go through the powerpoints in class, and stops in between slides to further explain and allows time for questions. Afterwards, there will be discussion question(s) and gives you time to discuss with your group mates, he will randomly ask a group to present their thoughts and discussion to the class. It is very casual, so there is no need to be nervous."
185,"He also doesn't mind students asking questions after class ended, and encourages students to speak to him. He is a very good instructor.Topics covered:"
186,- universal morality
187,- global justiceVery interactive (especially between the professor and the exchange students!) and thought-provoking!
188,"Prof. Brown tends to briefly introduce the philosopher/ background before going through the ppt slides. At the end of the class, there is always group discussion time."
189,"Prof. Brown always welcomes students to raise questions! :)As others have mentioned, covers a wide range of philosophy spanning over quite a wide time period, from western to eastern, long ago to current. Personally thought that it's pretty well organized in the sense that the later content will include some topics covered in the beginning. It was my first ever philosophy course and it was quite interesting to see an overview of some of the most popular philosophers. Gave me some general insight into the field.He's genuinely interested and passionate what he teaches -- to a point where you feel that he's sometime up in the clouds just really pondering about these theories."
190,"I was with a bunch of exchange students in our group and we were probably the most vocal in the class. Not sure why but he never came to our table to talk to us -- maybe we ask too many questions that don't have answers? Or can he not answer them, I dont know."
191,"If you have any questions, especially while studying for your exams, you should email him since he replies really quickly in great detail, too.In the first few lectures, you learn about types of musicals, the production team, and what it takes to turn a musical into a movie and vice versa, really simple stuff. There's a series of group presentations where you pitch an idea for a short musical and the idea with most votes gets selected to be performed by the whole class at an end of year performance.  This course doesn't require anybody to have prior knowledge or experience in theatre.There were two guest professors from HKAPA (Hong Kong Academy Of Performing Arts) who were there for the whole course. One, Mandy Petty, taught us dance and movement and the other, Mark Ngan, gave us vocal training. Both are extremely skilled and likeable. Once it comes to rehearsing for the performance, the teachers play a supporting role and let the whole event be student run, so there's a lot of freedom.This course has a relatively higher weighting in practice than teaching. Powerpoint and lectures are only taught for classes around and before add drop period i.e. for only a few classes (7-8?). All of the remaining time you will be learning singing and dancing, planning your musical and project and doing rehearsal.Isaac will be teaching singing. Mandy is a external tutor from the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts. She is an extremely talented and experienced person. She has so many stage experience that she could guide you through your classes and performance.We learned about different types of musicals, the production team, and what it takes to turn a musical into a movie and vice versa, really simple stuff. But not very useful in practically for me.simply lecture notes and simple dance. It was Dr. Lo who teach us but he moved to the US so it won't be him teaching anymore."
192,He is a nice guy but I think he didn't teach us really useful stuff. There wasn't a lot of teaching at class. Nothing much about music and drama skill.content mainly covered opera changes in different musical era in history.
193,- opera plot and composer biography
194,- style and music characteristics of different period
195,- basic music terminology
196,"not heavy and difficult, all covered in teaching materials"
197,will be a advantage if you have basic music knowledgeclear enough and quick response rate
198,videos of operas will be shown in every lectureThe course is a great introductory exposure to the world of classical music and opera. Most of the opera chosen to be reviewed have interesting stories and music so it's not so boring. The musical terms are not hard that a non-musical background person won't be able to understand.
199,"Isaac delves quite deep into the opera though, he'll cover the composer, story, musical theory, music style, artistic style and even the social economic background during the time of the opera.Isaac's a really knowledgeable and interesting professor. He's a professional opera singer too so he sometimes sings in class which is always entertaining. He tries to make classes fun and not boring, and you can tell he's really passionate about opera and the arts.The course mainly covers operas from Baroque to 20th Century. Students are expected to learn the plot, voice type, compositional devices etc of each opera.  It is relatively easy to understand as a 3000+ course even if you don't have any music background because it doesn't cover much on music terminology.Prof Droscha is a nice guy. He is willing to talk after-class and he treated students with pizza on the concert day."
200,"As for teaching, he is quite humorous in a way that he always try to tell jokes and make students laugh by singing in an ""operatic"" way."
201,"He tried to get the class to be more concentrate by asking you to do a few stretching with him, which is quite unique."
202,The only downside is that his ppt are always having too much words and it is not concise.A lot of content
203,Need to memorize it all
204,A lot of architecture words very long and difficult to remember
205,Each quizzes cover 4 powerpoints each with over 30 slides
206,Test about architectural features of different buildings and history  of architectureInstructor read the powerpoint
207,All the information tested are written on the powerpoints
208,No need to attend the lectures
209,Poor accent
210,"Very boringwestern architecture, content is fun.so boring.The grade is fair, because it's just a memory exam, if u spend more time to study it, you can get a good grade from it."
211,"Mean for 2 times midterms and above mean for the final, got B+only 2 midterm and final exam, no otjer workload at all."
212,"all things that are tested in mid-term and final are in the PPT, so u can just simply study the notes, but there are so many materials that u have to memorize, so it's better for u to have more time for the studying.The course covers from ancient Greek architecture to Contemporary architecture. For this course, it doesn't matter that whether you have studied history or not ( It might help a little bit if you do ). HUMA 2680 mainly focuses on memorizing features of the buildings and the background knowledge of different architecture styles and periods.Professor Kwong mainly follows the slides to present the ideas of the architecture and styles of construction,sometimes supported by examples and some extra materials.Great amount of architectures, architects, structures, principles, etc required to be memorised."
213,Historical background are included as related to the nature of architectures.
214,"Think twice if you are not really interested in the content.Going rather fast in class, but points are gone through well."
215,Attending lectures are helpful in the quizzes and exam.
216,Anna is a knowledgeable lecturer in art history.
217,"*1 voluntary visit is arranged.Covers all the major periods of western architecture from Greek architecture to contemporary architecture. Explanation of the the different styles and features through numerous iconic examples from all periods.The professor uses PowerPoint slides as the main guide. She covers each point on the slides with some additional explanation. While she is somewhat enthusiastic about the topics, the one hour twenty minute long lecture usually gets dull and boring towards the end.Feel like traveling around the world once after taking this course! From ancient Greek to modern architectures, in this course, you will be like reading a traveling magazines, view many popular architectures in different countries, e.g. the Eiffel tower, the pantheon, many serene churches etc.A very nice local professor, always welcome students to ask questions during the lectures or the exam check1    summarize how grammar works using the fundamental concepts of morphology and syntax"
218,"2    categorize morphemes, words, phrases and sentences in Mandarin Chinese according to their grammatical behaviors"
219,"3    identify the major similarities and differences in grammar between Chinese and English, and (particularly for local students) between Mandarin and Cantonese"
220,4    apply the concepts and analytical techniques to uncover rules and regularities from written Chinese data collected online or retrieved from large corpora
221,5    analyze the syntactic and semantic structure of a Chinese sentenceThis course is all in Chinese. While the professor is quite funny and kind. He is very patient to answer our questions or discuss with us.Mainly teaches how to break down sentences into different phrases and into words. Classify the relations between each structures and within the structure.
222,There are two main parts for the course:
223,"first half is mainly about how to differentiate between words and phrases, second half is mainly about sentence structure.The professor is quite funny."
224,"But the lesson time is quite long and may get bored after half class.The content is same as previous year which also contain three parts: 1)Linguistic universal and diversity, 2) Language as communication system and 3) Language as social artifact (focus on gender and age)."
225,"The first part maybe a bit boring for some people as it is mainly about plain linguistic knowledge (e.g. IPA system, vowels & consonants, etc.). Whereas the second and third part maybe better as they are quite related to our daily life.Prof. Yiu's english is very clear which probably won't have problems of following up. Her teaching way is normal which is not interesting at all. It also seems that she has improved her teaching style that she will do further explanations besides of reading the ppts. It is important to note that sometimes she will mention things which are not included or stated in the ppts but they will be also tested in the quizzes, so it is quite important to attend the lectures if you want to get an ""A"". Moreover, if you have any problems regarding the lectures or research paper, she is always willing to answer your questions after lessons or in her office hours. You can also make appointments for a thorough discussion of your research paper which I think this is very useful and helpful.Three parts of the teaching"
226,"1)Linguistic universal and diversity, about the application of IPA, quite important for the quiz"
227,"2)Communication: Language as a communication system, about how people communicate"
228,"3) Culture: Language as a social artefact, which I think that's the most interesting part for me and it is quite essential for the later research paperThe teaching style of Prof. Yiu may not be accepted by everybody as she always just read aloud from the powerpoint. However, when you asked her after class, she was always willing to chat with you which always provided constructive opinions for you. She is a good mentor.This course provides an overview to linguistics, covering topics including logic (logical propositions in language), conversation (implications in language) and politeness (principles that are innate to modern day speech). A technical approach is adopted, thus in contrast to the usual humanities course, where there are no correct answers, you are often expected to rationalize and provide a concrete response in huma3030. For those who have a mathematical/science mindset, this course is perhaps more suitable than other, essay-based humanities courses.Professor Zhang is an intriguing lecturer, with excellent command of multiple languages - which he will demonstrate in class. The professor delivers his classes extremely well, rarely straying away from relevant content. In-class questions are usually answered with examples; outside of class, the professor is also very approachable.Exploring how we humans communicate with each other and the language difference in different cultures. You would have a brief understanding in linguistics after taking the course. Topics include speech acts, cooperative principles, politeness principles etc.Not really engaging but sometimes Dr Zhang would have a few jokes to demonstrate some topics. The notes are packed with many words and terms, it takes time to really scan through all of them and have a basic understanding.The content of this course is actually pretty interesting.  However, the instructor do not send lecture notes to CANVAS, which means you are pretty lost if you do not attend many classes. She only gives her lecture notes in class. Thus, it is better to attend the classes as this course have PRS."
229,There are 3 major parts:
230,"Short Stories (parts of stories, irony, symbol, theme,...)"
231,"Poem (literary devices, types of poems,...)"
232,Drama (two examples are chosen: Oedipus the King and Trifles)
233,"Midterm will be on Short Story, Final will be on Poem and Drama."
234,"The course is fun without exams, exams are the real pain.The professor's teaching is good. She interacts with students a lot and reaches out to you if she thinks you need help.Short story, Poetry and Drama"
235,"Covered basic literature concepts such that students with no literature background can easily understand the concepts. Some Greek drama terms might be a bit hard to understand at first, but if you are genuinely interested in the content you will not find them too difficult.The professor likes interacting with students and please answer the question she has raised! She will remember those who has participated actively in class, which is also good for your participation score too (Plus, there is no right or wrong in literature and everyone can have their own interpretation, so only by discussion can you really understand the fun part of literature)Three core parts: short stories, poems and drama. For short stories, 5 stories will be taught in class. You will learn to identify the themes and the literature devices used in every stories. This parts takes up to 50% of the course. However, it only appears in your mid-term exam."
236,"After the mid-term, 4 sets(5-6 poems per set) of poems and 2 drama scripts will be covered. They will appear in your final exam. Creative writing on a poem is also assigned, which I will introduce later. Similarly, you will also learn to identify the themes and devices used in poems and drama scripts.Not bad. You can see that she is well prepared for lectures and tries to make literature more interesting. I think she should upload all lecture notes to Canvas to allow online revision.Short stories, poetry and drama."
237,The texts were interesting and beautiful and touching etc. I am very happy to be introduced to these works of literature.
238,"In general, you get a short story per week (3 to 4 pages) which you may read before the lecture. There were a few poems. Most texts would not be as challenging as Shakespearean works, but your English proficiency may still affect your understanding. There will be detailed explanation and discussion in the lectures."
239,"The drama part will be mostly focused on Oedipus the King and Trifles. You are recommended to buy Oedipus the King, which is a cheap little book and a good read anyway.Very good presentation and explanation of literary works and devices. She is a great teacher, encourages discussions and likes to get response from students. Enjoyable.This course will introduce students to methods of reading western literary texts in English. The professor would cover 3 aspects of the Western Literature - short stories, poems and drama.  Texts chosen will be those exploring aspects of initiation, romance and family, social and cultural issues in race, gender, and identity. Since literature is a window on culture and humanity, the course aims to deepen students¡¯ understanding of people from different cultures and the complexity of life.Ms. Lisa is a really sweet professor and has a great understanding for literature. She expects you to read the class material in advance and discusses the main things about the subject material in class."
240,"She is also really helpful if you approach her in office hours.Narrative, Poetry and Drama are covered in class."
241,"Mid-term is covers Narrative, while the Final covers both Poetry and Drama."
242,"Oedipus the King and Trifles were the required reading for Drama. As for Narrative and Poetry, an extensive range was given.Professor Wong is very passionate about literature and chose a wide range of narratives and poems to analyse in class. She carefully guides students through the text ensuring that each line is understood. She encourages interaction in class for the sharing of different perspectives of the same text. Hence, participation is rewarded."
243,"Professor Wong is also encourages students to ask questions whether in class, or through email/consultation, as she understands many students may not have any background in Literature.As previous reviews mentioned, the course is divided into three main parts: short stories, poetry and plays. Timing-wise, each component takes up around 1/3 of the time."
244,"As the course title suggests, it teaches basic skills of literature such as identifying different literary devices, analyzing plot, style (short stories), usage of meter, rhyming, musicality (poetry), dialogue, soliloquy, setting, emotions, and so on (plays). Of course, this is merely part of the content and it is highly recommended for you to give this course a try first."
245,"PS: Reading materials are great!Perhaps it comes with experience, but the overall pace of the class is comfortable. The class lasts for an hour and 20 minutes, and I believe class discussions took up more than half of the time. Lisa is patient enough for everyone to speak their minds and discuss the content of the reading materials even though we don't always make sense."
246,"It is quite the perfect class if you wish to learn about literature from scratch like me!Course is split into 3 main parts: Short Stories, Plays and Poems. Course is pretty similar to IB English Literature in that you will be analysing the Stories etc. The types of stories, plays and poems vary a lot an touch upon several different themes such as race, gender, societal norms and identity. The course can be very interesting if you have an aptitude and appreciation for English LiteratureLisa Wong was a pretty good professor overall. She was very open to answering questions during class as well as after class, and very flexible with making appointments to see her. To get the best of the class, it's better to be engaged and ask/ answer her questions rather than being quiet the whole time. She tends to remember names of those who are more active in class."
247,"One thing I didn't like was that she didn't upload her powerpoints onto canvas which can be annoying. If you can't get all the notes written down during class, you're pretty much out of luck unless someone else wrote it down. Lots of things discussed during classes are on the exams and not all of it is covered in the notes she givesFrom the syllabus:"
248,"This course will introduce students to methods of reading western literary texts in English. Its focus is on short stories, poems, and plays. Students will learn to analyze the artistic and imaginative use of language, and develop the ability to think creatively and critically. Texts chosen will be those exploring aspects of initiation, romance and family, social and cultural issues in race, gender, and identity. Since literature is a window on culture, the course aims to deepen students¡¯ understanding of people from other cultures and the complexity of life.Prof Lisa is very helpful and tries her best to answer your questions. She is very knowledgable in the area of Literature and tries her best to make the class fun."
249,"The only thing about this course is that she doesn't upload powerpoint slides on Canvas/LMES. So I had to jot notes down to make sure I didn't miss anything. E.g., If you skip classes, you might have the possibility that you might miss something important for the midterm.3 main parts in the course:"
250,short stories - various topics including romance and detective etc.
251,poems
252,"dramaHelpful and knowledgeable professor, feel free to ask questions after class."
253,"No powerpoint slides on lmes, have to jot notes (and occasionally take photos) in class."
254,"Reminder: sit in the front of classroom, professor often uses the whiteboard for teaching and you won't be able to see if you sit after the 8th row"
255,"Always have in-class discussion, no cold calling thoughStort stories,poems,drama"
256,"Techniques, analysisShort stories, drama (plays) and poetry"
257,"This semester's play (there were about 2-3 plays, the main focus was on Oedipus, a Greek tragedy). Students are strongly recommended to buy the book (or have the latest copy) so that they can have a general idea of the content for the finals.Reading more of the reading materials beforehand will help in understanding lectures, attendance is taken through PRS while the questions will be mainly about the text the class will be discussing for that lecture.type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content here type your comment about content heretype your comment about teaching here type your comment about teaching heretype your comment about teaching heretype your comment about teaching heretype your comment about teaching heretype your comment about teaching heretype your comment about teaching heretype your comment about teaching heretype your comment about teaching hereThe content included some poems and short stories, two movies were also included. This course suits students who really like literature. The content overall was interesting, because the themes ""love"" and ""death"" are something related to life, it definitely raised a lot of thoughts. There were also two lessons for discussion, students could freely express their opinions, just like friends chatting in a big group, very thought-provoking.The Prof always encourage students to answer her questions, and she could give in-depth analysis for the poems and stories. She is quite a nice prof, she is willing to answer questions from students.mostly in English, sometime Mandarin"
258,"discussion is encouragedThis course concentrates on the themes of love and death in literature and on ways and the cultural milieu in which writers have handled these themes. It is the aim of this course to guide students to approach literature as a form of entertainment and enlightenment. We will study not only canonical works of ¡°high¡± literature but those of popular literature as well. For students who wish to learn the interpretive strategies and understand the thematic significance of literary texts, this course provides guidance to both aesthetic appreciation and recognition of psychological and philosophical issues raised in literature. Readings are primarily poems and short stories. We will also watch some films and discuss the relation of film and literature in terms of these themes. Topics include the construction of subjectivity, gender and sexuality, self and society, and the meaning of existence in the modern world."
259,Half of the readings are in Chinese. Students are expected to have a reading ability of Chinese. The course will be conducted in English.
260,¦Ë Class attendance. Attendance is absolutely essential to this course. Absences exceeding one allowance will result in a lower grade.
261,¦Ë Participation. Students should prepare the required reading before each lecture and actively participate in class as well as in group discussion.
262,¦Ë Midterm exam. Essay questions.
263,¦Ë Final exam. Essay questions.Discussion
264,"Attendancethe content mostly about culture but it was a bit boring. Some vocabulary are very difficult.The teaching are quite ok. Sometime the professor will play video. However, sometime are quite boring.The grading is a bit tough. Even I have follow the guideline, I only have C+.The workload are quite heavy. Every two weeks have a discuss topic which require us to talk at least  3 time to get some marks. Furthermore, each two weeks have some online homework to finish. The essay tittle are quite difficult which require us to think at different point of view.I Don't know yet!I did learn a lot from prof Yan Lianke s courses."
265,Q&A session is not interesting at all.There are only 3 quizzes and attendance.
266,"It is mainly about different ideas from different philophers.The lesson will be based on discussion. It should be good but to be honest I didn't listen much to it.The grading is only based on 3 quizzes and attendance. I get above mean for less than or for the first 2 quizzes (I do not know the results of my last quiz) and I get a- finally.The workload is quite low. Though there will be readings, I didn't read any of them as I think most of the questions in the quiz will be based on the slides.I am personally very interested in ethics and morality so I rate the content very highly. The first part of the semester you look at three big ethical theories - Virtue Ethics, Deontology, and Utilitarianism. Then you try and apply these different ways of thinking to issues we face in society today ,such as Climate change, animal rights, and poverty. I found the content very relevant and eye-opening.I did like the professor because he never told you how to think, he always presented both sides of an argument and tried to get people to do the same. He also spent a lot of time explaining concepts which i personally enjoyed because sometimes I had no idea what the text meant. However, his powerpoints were just walls of text. They did come in handy though when you needed to revise.The content is not very hard, and gets more and more interested."
267,"1st part: Ethical Theories. Aristotle's Virtue Ethics, Kant's Deontology."
268,"2nd part: Ethical Theories and Contemporary issues. Mill's and Bentham's Utilitarianism. Discussion about crime and punishment, death penalty."
269,3rd part: Contemporary issues
270,"Euthanasia, hunger and poverty, animal rights and environment."
271,"I think the ""contemporary issues"" part is quite fun and I'm really intersted in it. It is related to our lives and it makes me think about how I should treat the animals and the environment, which are some topics that I have never thought thoroughly before!! And the theories are the basic theories of the ethics world. It is of no disadvantage knowing more of it as long as you are interested. The theories learnt in the first part will be applied in the 2nd and 3rd part. So I kinda felt like the knowledge is really ""applied""haahah.The teaching is a bit boring. The professor is somehow just reading the PPT. If you read the materials, it would be much clearer because he explains the key parts."
272,"The ppt is really ugly cause THERE ARE ONLY WORDS ON IT. And the structure is quite boring. But be careful with the ppt. This semester, there are questions like ""what are the 2nd and 3rd point of XXXX""(6 points raised in class)"
273,"There are group discussions every class. The group is randomly assigned and if your group is active(like mine), you get interesting insights from your peers."
274,"The TA is very nice, he speaks cantonese, mandarin and of course,English fluently .basically what you expect from a philosophy course; the material overlaps with yuma 1000b this term actually, but here its more detail oriented while huma1000b has a more macro viewthe class is divided into groups of around 6 people, and the prof alloacted a lot of discussion time so don't take the course if you're not the type of person who likes to think and chip inAt the beginning of the course, it mainly focuses on virtue ethics, utilitarianism and deontology. After that, the course includes some contemporary issues, such as punishment, animal rights, world hunger and land ethic, which are required to apply the 3 theories learnt.I think the teaching style is quite good. In each lecture, the instructor explains the theories in the first half of the lesson. In another half, students are discussing in groups about some questions raised by the instructor. He and the TA join different groups to discuss, which make us know the topic better. The instructor is very friendly, which makes the lessons relaxing.Dr.Qiu does not speak very fluent English, but it does not affect your understanding of the content. Also, she often looks at the computer or her notes while she is teaching £¨I guess that is because her spoken English is not very good, she just wants to make sure she does not speak anything wrong£©. Hence, there are many students feel bored during classes."
275,"However, she is definitely a sincere teacher. Although she won't create any quizzes for what she has taught, she still pays lots of effort on the course content £¨e.g. using various examples£©."
276,"Also, she does care students. Before the first tutorial, every student was asked to prepare a brief introduction of his or her cultural background. She memorized all! She often asks the cultural experience of some students base on their characteristics and background. For example, when we are talking about the life in student hall, she may ""interview"" students from foreign countries.  £¨This is quite nice). She is also quite acceptive. One of our students was not available to do the presentation, she allowed him to make a video. If you find it difficult to do your presentation on the designated date, you could talk to her and postpone your presentation £¨if no time clash£©. Also, the deadline for submitting the final paper is quite late £¨the last day of examination£©.  "
277,"Besides, the learning atmosphere she creates is quite relaxing. For example, there's a group providing snacks to the audience during the presentation. She's chilled with that."
278,"In conclusion, she seems not very good at giving a lecture, but she is extremely nice,  considerate and supportive.This course is a critical introduction to the concept of communityfrom interdisciplinary perspectives."
279,"? It explores the origins of the idea of community in Western utopian thought,"
280,"? the study of traditional and urban society in classical sociologyand anthropology,"
281,"?the enduring nostalgia for the idea of community as a source of security, belonging and identityin an increasingly insecure worldshaped by individualism, globalization, and the changing modes of communicationThe course explore case studiesof local multicultural communities in Hong Kong shaped by religion,lifestyles, ethnicity,nationalism,immigrationand emigration."
282,"?It tackles China¡¯s urbanism and its impacts on rural communitiesthrough migration of peasant worker, and also the impacts on urban communities through the development of gentrification and gated community."
283,?It also examine the Taiwan state program of community construction
284,"FieldtripsandWork sheet will provide students with first-hand exposure and understanding of communal experiences through practices.The teaching is interesting with group discussions included, and sometimes will let us draw to present what we think about a certain culture or issue.you will learn about concepts of anthropology and sociology.  They are not very difficultHe talks quite slowly, and you can easily understand what he is talking about.  He will ask questions, call your names in the class, but even you dont know the ans. or even tell him that you have no idea, he will just ask somebody who knows the ans.About humanities, mainly focused on identities: how would you classify yourself (not) belongs to a group. Should have basic knowledge learnt in DSE."
285,Professor used the historical approach to explain each factor affecting identities. It is extremely boring.
286,"As a business students, I don't know why I need to study this. Perhaps the only use is to fulfill HUMA-SSC.I didn't attend lectures after midterm."
287,Lectures: D
288,"Before midterm, what I could learn from him is ""Hi...thanks"". He wants to keep us quiet but as his content is so boring, no one want to listen to him. It is even more disastrous that his voice is too soft and unclear. Though there may be PRS questions, I skipped all the lessons after midterm. Can't withstand at all."
289,Tutorial: B
290,"Nigel is a nice tutor, but he sticks to the plan closely. Nothing should be diverted in his session. He is easy going though. In this course, tutors are controlling 50% of your course marks, so they are more important. Follow what he/she wants will be good. If you are in Nigel's class, you are quite lucky. His grading is somewhat lenient. Ask him after workshops if you want detailed comments, usually his comments written on Canvas are short and brief.different topics about ethics and morality are disucssed. many examples are given and try to stimulate us to think more from different perspectives and from a wider angle. some topics are quite hard to understand, you may have to look up extra information in internet. you will find your lecture more meaningful if you finish the assigned readings before every lecture. it will help you understand more.Professor will ask you to finish the assigned readings every week. Actually there are qutie a lot readings to be finished if you are hard-working. He will only discuss some of them during lesson. There are some video-playings during lesson as well. Maybe try to relax us. also, PRS is sometimes used to get our opinions in different topics, trying to involve us more through discussion.Boring stuff, all abt family, rituals, religions and etc, uselessPoor teaching, I don't think i learnt anything from the lectures and workshops. And especially for the writing workshops u have no idea on what's going on, the only incentive for me to attend those workshops was probably attendance marks.rubbish"
291,"ethics, beauty and love"
292,everyone knows
293,The quizzes asked some very difficult questions that you cannot memorize even though you study hard for it.Lecturer is rubbish
294,Tutor is good and she gave us some comment on our essay although she only marked introduction+1 paragraph+ending of the essay. You cannot know your tutor before hand :(Mainly about identities
295,relationships
296,most students mentioned Hong Kong and Chins
297,DSE LS
298,Many readings
299,"boringBoring, ineffective pace"
300,I went to tutorials because of attendance
301,"the teacher always ask students to discuss our essays during the lesson, which I found not very usefuleasy content with concepts well explained. Include different moral theories and how to build up an academic essaythe accent of professor is not good. Yet, he's passionate in teaching and encourages discussionnot too well if your english is not good. Try to score high in the quiz to secure a higher sub grade. The mean score in the class is around 12/20, I got 14/20, attended all tutorial. Finally, a- while skipping 60% of classlight workload. make sure that you attend all the tutorial and the briefing before the quizzesWhat do you expect in a humanities course anyway... There isn't much content but isn't that what students want? Even if you skip the lecture that is held only once each week, you still can revise for the quiz! I am really grateful for the fact that all course material is on canvas, but beware that if you want the lecture videos, it is only up for the first week, for the remaining weeks after the add-drop period, there is none (which I don't think is necessary anyway).Teaching is quite boring. Even if I go to lectures, most people are not concentrating in class. But to be fair, the lecturer put in quite a lot of effort in preparing class materials. Occasionally, there are interesting materials shown like 'Hello BItches' music videos and etc... (I just forgot really there is a lot) so basically go to lectures for sleep and prepare to be surprised from time to time :)very boring Chinese traditional concepts"
302,at least I dont think anyone would be interested.not much (usefull/ practical) taught
303,or maybe I skipped too much lessons?
304,and those Mandarin-pronounce-based English words on both lecture notes and quiz questions sucks
305,I didn't understand one:)Lecture content is typical huma course content.The tutor is open-minded. The content of your essay is not restricted to any special direction. You can feel free to express anything you want to share in your essay.The lecture teaching is average.
306,"Tutorial teaching is quite well organized, basically guide us to complete the whole essay.The content of the course is fine and it is about culture and identity.The teaching is extremely extremely boring. The powerpoint prepared by the professor only contains pictures or tables or graphs, with no words at all. It makes revision for the quiz become difficult, but reviewing the lecture video may help.The content varies for each semester, the semester I took taught about the different factors that alter one's identity uptake and 2 others topics. The powerpoint slides are super simple, you need to refer to the lecture video if you skip lesson and would like to review the lecture. I'm not really so interested in the topic so just B.Good professor and tutor.The contents from class were not so difficult, easy to understand, yet a bit boring. Attendance not required which is good (the class starts early in the morning on Fridays).Enthusiastic teaching. Just the contents are not so interesting. There were required readings but not so necessary. Pay more attention to the presentations.The L1 course was fousing on the philosophical perspective, which discussing about the righteousness, destiny and well-being. This course included the lectures and tutorials, where the lecture would take attendence with PRS/iPRS and taught some theories, such as moral theories, while the tutorial would teach you how to write a essay. Before the letures, there were some reading materials to read, and in the letures, there were two quizzes in class. Most importantly was the essay, 50% garding was based on the essay and the three essay topic showed on the first lecture that you can prepare as soon as possible. There was not presentation in the scheme but you can answer the questions during the lecture (it may affect the sub-grade).The teaching was great and the lecturer was humor and can explain the theories and contents clearly. For example, using the daily example to explain the difficult philosophical theories. However, he put more time on the ethical theories, such as utilitarianism, kantianism, confucianism. mohism (it is enough for you to write an essay), the destiny and well-being are not be talking much. The workshop guided you to write an essay step by step. Generally, the teaching was great and useful.quite good"
307,"inc. some movie clips and interesting life examples.For those local students who find the course difficult to understand, the lecturer will provide Cantonese lectures."
308,"Students can also consult lecturer for the essay. He will provide useful feedback.Mainly about language, culture, identity"
309,Some about how language affect your thought and also the role of nonverbal language play
310,It also digs into Hong Kong people and something about their sense of belongings.
311,There will be powerpoint as well as video during lessons
312,Reading materials will be givenPAN's English is easy to follow and she gives example to make the concept clear
313,"However, not much people listening to her as the topic is quite boring"
314,"Videos will be played during classes and it will be quizzeddifficult to understand for engineering students. lots of contents are known to students from other schools. it is not beneficial to engineering students with weak English level.the instructor taught well, explaining a lot of details without powerpoint.it is fun when it come with the content about Western morality. But it is bored when it come with Chinese traditional philosophy. Just personal thought. Overall, the content can be useful for your further study and after graduation work regardless your major.it is normal. but Dr. Nam sometimes joke with the class making it less boring.Content mostly useless after the quiz (except the chapter related to your essay topic). The in-class quiz covered the content from week 2 - week 7. Lecture videos would be provided for revision purpose. The questions in the quiz covered the content on the slide (ard. 40%), extra content mentioned by the prof during lecture (e.g. name, example; ard. 40%) and reading materials (only concept; ard. 20%). Therefore, watching the lecture videos is the top priority as for the revision, then the slides and lastly the reading materials.Pro. Zhang reli have a good speaking skill & pronunciation. The content of the lecture is very important as the slides only contain a few words and pictures. Do not expect that you are able to understand the slides without listening to him once (i.e. can be through lecture video)Lecture 1: Identity and community: family"

326,"The course covers a wide range of philosophical topics such as Utilitarianism, Taoism, Kantianism, Confucianism etc."
327,It is not a must to attend lectures as you can look through all the ppts. All tutorials require attendance.The Prof tried as much as he can to explain the philosophical topics interestingly yet the lectures are still tedious.

Then you are good. As for the tutorials, they are just the extension of Lang 1003 to guide you to write an academic essay.Nam Sai Lok is quite a nice and decent lecturer who is trying to make your life easier by minimizing your workload. He showed videos like matrix and saving private ryan in the class and included current affairs which were closely related to us as teaching material. Quite a brilliant way to express theories which are vague in a simple and attractive manner.It is quite boring at all. I do not enjoy having this class."
344,The content is about the culture of different group of people.I do not like the lecturer but I think the tutor is quite helpful and easy-going. Susana would offer useful suggestions.I think it is fine for year2 students or above.
345,The final essay basically equal to your grade unless you get very low mark in quizzes.

However, he at least tried to be funny and make the lectures interesting. (even though it didn't work....)The content is related mostly to social phenomenon. It may not sound easy at first but some of the topics covered did inspired me in certain aspect of life and is pretty enlightening. Although lecture is not necessary but it is quite fun.Teaching is good with example explaining some of the theory that could sound difficult to comprehend. The instructors are engaging and are willing to answer student's question on both the contents and the assignment with some good advises. The instructor even setup a session after the lecture for questions.There is only on lesson per week, and attendance is required. There will be iprs questions each lesson for attendance. However the teaching material is not too interesting.Not allowed to use laptop during class, personally I think the teaching could be more clear and straight forward.About different Chinese and Western philosophies such as Confucianism and Utilitarianism.

Be sure to put enough effort into writing the 1000 word essay, should be fine if the structure and the logic of the essay is clear.Although there is no final exams, there are still 2 quizzes, 1 final essay, and online discussion to participate.

Course materials covers a wide range of topics ranging from Happiness VS Pleasure to the evil human instants.In the tutorial, Mr. Levi LAM's teaching definitely deserves an A, while personally, i'm giving an E to Prof. CHONG, Kim Chong for that I didn't hear no English from him in lecture. Maybe it's my problem."
386,The supports on the essay from Mr. Levi LAM is very helpful all the way from the clear and easy-to-follow instruction he gave at the first place to his tailor made advice on you work.Lecture:
387,will have ppt uploaded to Canvas
388,extra examples will be given for u to be used in your final essay
389,Tutorial:
390,Content simple and short
391,though not that useful but cannot skipTutor nice and funny
392,"Comments he given in the last tutorial was useful to modify our final essay and ensure that what we write is what he wantsThe content about utilitarianism was indeed fun, but the other 3 types of moral thinking was boring and was hard to understand because the content materials were quite vague.Fun in general, the professor often make scenarios which are worth thinking. The movie ( Saving Private Ryan ) watched in the lecture was attracting but was hard to find the connection with teaching materials.Decent content, easily comprehensible but at times boring.The content is self explanatory and doesn't really require much teaching to understand. Regardless, the instructor does a good job explaining the various scenarios.Easy to follow. An introduction of moral philosophy, including Kantianism, utilitarianism and other Chinese philosophy.Quite good. Dr Nam is a good teacher, such as he used relevant clips or movies to illustrate the abstract part of the philosophy.The grading system mainly depends on the essay. I got the marks around mean in two quizzes. A bit passive attitude in the discussion forum. But my tutor said my essay is quite good then my final grade is A-.Two quizzes ,one essay, attendance and three times of discussion forum. Twice-a-week tutorial for the essay, which means you can write a paragraph for each workshop and finish the essay with ease in the end.Topic about moral ethics e.g. Utilitarianism, Confucianism."
393,The content is quite boring.
394,"There are several writing workshops that have to be attended which helps on the final essay.The teaching is fair. Professor tried to make the content more interesting but lessons were still boring.Not a practical lesson but interesting to those who love philosophyDull lesson and sleepyI got an A- as my final grade, but it doesn't mean that this instructor is great as the final grade is given by your tutorial instructor instead of the lecturer.Comparatively speaking, the workload is average."
395,A total of 2 quizzes and 5 online discussion are taken into account for assessing your grading.
396,Attendance is optional as it is only counted as bonus point to your grading but not compulsory.
397,"However, the most important factor contributing to your final grade is the performance of your FINAL ESSAY. The fact is that even with a high score in quizzes, a poor FINAL ESSAY really affects your grade finally.The course is divided into two parts, lecturing and writing workshops. You listen and learn different moral ethics during lectures, for example utilitarianism, kantianism, mohism and so on. You then apply what you have learnt in your final essay, which you will learn how exactly should you write it in the five writing workshops that you are required to attend. Overall it is a course that teaches you both essay writing techniques and traditional moral ethics, which is quite useful as it is an eye opener and essay writing skills are essential in university life.The teaching is acceptable, the professor who delivered the lectures had terrible English so it was quite a struggle to listen. The professor who taught me in the writing workshop was quite helpful and friendly so generally it was nice.Content is interesting. Course explores culture - specifically, values of diversity, equality, and resistance. Topics explored are: sex and marriage, religion, food, inequality, gender relations, ritual, religion, rebellion.Professor was hard to understand and follow at times and made the interesting concepts/topics boring - rambled through most of the lecture. Workshop teachers are very helpful though - they thoroughly assist and advice you in the writing of your essay which is the main bulk of the grade.Only covers 4 main moral theories and the last 1/3 lectures can be not attended as they are out of syllabus. It's quite boring.Professor Nam speaks chinglish which is hard to understand and his pace of teaching is slow and plain. Yet the teaching of the TA is practical and useful comments are given.rich content about different cultural topics"
398,powerpoints with a lot of examples but quite boring
399,"*tips: if you want to enroll into huma1000 successfully, choose a tutorial with the least wait-listi didnt attend all lectures and i find the lectures not interactive and responsive as it seems the prof is teaching all the time"
400,"tutorial: also boring and i dont think it really helps much in my essay writingPhilosophical concepts including morality and ethics are discussed. Utilitarianism, Kantiansim, Confucianism,  Mohism, Daoism, concept of Destiny, and different ideologies of Confucianists are introduced.Did not attend class as there are not much content for quiz, few lectures I attended were not that interesting."
401,"The teaching of tutorial was comparatively interesting, featuring how to communicate one's idea effectively through writing. Moreover, the feedback of the tutorial was very helpful for the final essay, though lectures are not essential to attend, tutorials were very useful. (no attendance in lecture but tutorial)It's meaningless for students to study culture, resistance and religion. I cannot find the core values after I studied this course.The prof. NEVER upload the ppt before the lectures. You have to pay attention in the class. She likes to walking around and ask us questions.Good grade. I think if you finished all the online quiz, in class quiz and attend all the lectures, you can get B+ or above.The workload is huge since there were lots of online quizzes. And you have to read all the assigned readings in order to get a high marks in the in class quiz as well.as mentioned in the course name, it basically tells the cultures and values in various countries, but most of the time professor would use the US as an example to demonstrate the difference between the east and the west. The content is not difficult to handle and it is more like a talk show, you can learn with ease.Interesting professor from Taiwan. Open and funny. Not boring as she talks about different stories and sometimes jokes a bit. PRS is taken for 3 lessons randomly. Even though you skip the lectures, you can still read the ppt and catch up on your own without much problem. PPT is uploaded to Canvas after each lecture. BTW, professor doesn't quite like the students using computers or phones during lessons.Western and Chinese philosophyDr Nam is the worst professor I have ever met in my life. You simply cannot understand what he's saying and if you understand, it's too boring to stay focused. The only reason to go to class was iPRS."
402,"However, the TA - Eugene Li was very helpful. He explains how to write your essay well and gives you a good feedback.complete bs, basically common sense stuffs such as gender equality and culture stuffs. Some topics are interesting-- but your final essay content could be completely irrelevant to the stuffs you learn in lectures, because tutorial classes teaches you how to write a proper essay instead of reviewing lecture notes.Lectures- E. The professor does not know how to teach. It was already stated in the first class that lectures are optional, however there would be 3% of IPRS quiz."
403,"Tutorials- C. It is a good review of essay writing, however it is rather simple because you basically learn primary stuffs such as thesis statement etc. You are encouraged to write a 5 paragraph essay and the tutor is rather picky on your organisation rather than the content.The content is fundamental but it's still more than enough as a 1000-level course. It teaches about Kantianism, confucianism, daosim, etc."
404,"Only first half of the course content is assesses in the quiz.The accent of Prof. Nam is quite disgusting I would say lol. Regardless of that, he's a good professor who is willing to answer your enquiries after lectures and possess a certain sense of humour. He often use analytical questions to arouse discussions in lecture, through which I think is the most effective part of the course that let me understand those philosophical concept."
405,"p.s you have no idea who's your tutor for tutorial. My tutor was Sue Chang from language center, which I found is totally useless for both the course and my life."
406,"p.p.s. attendance for tutorial is compulsory, so hope you get a good tutor. Luckily, there's only 5 tutorials in one semester.content contained general ideas about religion, gender and other aspects of society.The classes aren't as exciting as they should betwo quizzes and bonus on attendance in the lectures. The essay counts for 50% and the rest of it is around 10% each including online work and in class workThe tutorials are a lot more important, since they discuss your essay and ideas. They are compulsory attendance classes. The online work material is fairly easy and can be completed on time. The in class work is almost always finished in class and very little is asked to be completed later.Interesting content as you get to watch some movies (In my case, the life of Pi) - Then you have to write a report. Content is easy to follow.Lectures were quite long and you have to attend mandatory tutorials as well so it takes significant time. Lectures are fun but tutorials can be extremely boring.Grading is extremely fair. I wrote my report and was told to fix certain content in my report however due to my workload, decided to submit the work without any changes. Received a B regardless so I it is quite fairQuite a bit of workloadA little boring but an easy elective. Highly recommend taking this class.Pretty average class. Pay attention and you'll be fine. Teaching style is nothing incredibly different from other professors at HKUSTGrading is fair. The essay portion of the class fulfills most of the grade. If you put the work in, this will be an easy class to get an A in.Manageable. If you plan your time right, this class will be very easy for you. It's a nice class to take alongside more technical core classes.The section I took was about linguistics and languages. The main reason I took this section was because it sounded really interesting, and the lecture content itself was pretty interesting (although very, very theory based and you have to remember every little detail for the quizzes).The teaching was alright, but it is a class of 400 students so you can imagine that most students aren't paying attention to the professor. I approached her once regarding my essay structure, and she was very helpful and suggested some improvements regarding my points etc. My writing workshop instructor was Prof. Siu, and he was very nice and helped me on my essay.Things taught in lessons is very inspiring. Many reading articles are recommended and they are all good to read. The course led you to think more about human beings.Lectures are boring and power point is not reader friendly. Self studying will be better.Mostly weighted on the final essay which depends a lot on your English composition ability. There are PRS during lessons and will be counted as attendance. Quizes will be very much related to the powerpoint.Many compulsory work and fixed time frame for assignment. But the deadline helps spread your workload across the semester.my topic is about happinessThe topic is quite interesting but the lesson is quite boringgood grade"

415,"the main task is writing essay, but if you can do it well then you can get good gradeIt doesn't matter which lecture you choose - the content for all sessions would be quite boring for most people. This is a good course for its grade and medium workload, nothing much else. However, if you take the tutorials seriously enough, your English writing ability will improve slightly.The professors aren't very passionate. Lectures can be incredibly boring - nobody listens to anything. Tutorials are more interactive, and can help you write a better essay for submission.If you love Greek/Chinese philosophy, then this course will benefit you a lot. My lecture (L3) covers both East and West values on social participation, family practises and self realisation. It can be quite boring sometimes when professor teaches about theories and showing videos/movies film in the 1960s Lol...Well my mainland professor's english pronunciation is quite strange and her tone is weird. She sounds like a robot. Before ending each lesson, she will pick one or two students to answer her question or raising questions, tho students seldom respond. Most of the students attend the lecture because of PRS, totally ignoring the professor's teaching.there is quite lot of content but none are important coz you wont memorize them"
416,"have fun n 9 write the essayoh i did attend the lecture, but i didnt listen at all, its fking boring :)its goood, i didnt do much of the discussion and the essay is totally mess, i dont even know what i am writing about and i still got a C+.one essay and 2 quizzes and many discussion."
417,"the essay i cant help you, coz i barely understand the topic."
418,"as for the quizzes, dont study unless you damn hard preparing it, the questions it ask are dumb and  very detail, btw u can use own common sense to answer it."
419,"discussion-----screw itThere were three topics including Chinese philosophy, social issues etc. Personally saying, social issues was the easiest topic for your essay.Lectures are optional but tutorials are really important as it counts the attendance heavily. The instructor of tutorial was nice and caring who gave lots of useful advice in how to write a clear thesis statement and topic sentences.Chinese and Western Values"
420,"Destiny...Not clearIf you can write well and quoting what you have learnt correctly,  above mean in the quizzes, make comment in online discussion, getting an A is easy."
421,The essay question is like this.
422,1.Would you travel back in time to kill your roommate in the above circumstances? Provide a sound argument to support your decision using what you have learned on this course
423,"2.Suppose that, in the future, technology exists which makes any kind of transplant possible and that the transplants are legal and affordable for all, do you think that the situation described in the film The Island is morally permissible? Using what you have learned on this course, present an argument to support your stance on this question."
424,"3. If your mother and your wife fall into the sea at the same time and you are only allowed to save one of them, who will you save?(sth like this)A lot of reading materials"
425,2 in-class quizzes
426,1 essay
427,"The workload is not heavy.Topic: Utilitarianism, Confucianism, Destiny and principle of happiness."
428,It is quite interesting and thought-provoking. It requires you to make decision from different perspectives. Every question has no fixed answers. You only need to answer them logically by using some school of thoughts he has taught before.
429,"If you don't mind reading and understanding the traditional Chinese and Western philosophies in English. It would be an interesting course for you.Dr Nam's English is not easy for listening but I would say it is satisfactory. Sometimes, you may find difficulties in understanding some theories from his English, especially for Mencius and Confucianism. Therefore, you may need to review his powerpoint afterwards or beforehand so that you can catch up."
430,"In the tutorial section, my tutor is Lee Pui. He is very familiar with different theories taught in the lecture and he can figure out your mistakes and logical problems immediately in the essay. Actually, I think attend the tutorial is more important than lecture since it all cares about your final essay and guide you how to write it.The content in my semester was very boring and weird. I often had to search on internet to understand it.Professor only read the powerpoint during the lecture.There were 2 mc quizzes and 1 essay needed to hand in. 2 mc quizzes were quite difficult as I was needed to understand concepts and points delivered by the lecture."
431,"The essay was more important than the quizzes, so as long as you put effort on writing a good essay, you can still get a relatively good grade even you failed those quizzesOne essay although took some time. So you better prepare writing one before the deadline.I think it was L2 but im not really sure. It was about Chinese/Western philosophy - it covers utilitarianism, kant, daoism, Confucianism and many more. I actually enjoyed the content mainly because I like to learn about philosophy and understand some of human's intrinsic way of thinking. Some of the case studies were actually quite interesting.Poor english... Very boring teaching style. But he really tries to engage students in the lecture and makes some funny jokes.Boring - don't learn much in this class. Teachers just talk about irrelevant things and often go off topic. Topics are often very complicated and they do not explain the basics.Boring, class is usually irrelevant to what is needed for the deliverables.The content in my semester is language and culture which I find it very boring.Professor only read according to the powerpoint during the lecture.There were 2 mc quizzes and 1 essay needed to hand in. 2 mc quizzes were difficult as it required you to remember most of the concepts and points delivered by the professor which was about more than 200 powerpoint slides for each quizzes. But the essay was far more important than those quizzes, so as long as you put effort on writing a good essay, you can still get a relatively good grade even you failed those quizzes.Only 1 essay needed to be handed in and also some simple exercises needed to be done in ust connect every two weeks.The L1 lecture is about the the relationship between pleasure , happiness and good life and the meaning of http://life.It is about some philosophical theories.i think the tutor is quite good. I don't listen to the prof. His voice is very soft and he speaks very slow. You may find it difficult to follow his mind.the grading is good. I think my essay is not good enough but i got a b+ at last."

437,also talks about in both chinese and western persepctive.
438,They actually talk alot about chinese culture.
439,"As a non-chinese background international student, I didn't like that some chinese names popped up on the quiz, but that was only one mark.Boring lecture, but Dr.Zhang is nice and quite good to talk to if you have any further questions"
440,But her teaching is organized and her notes are good to use when you write your essay.
441,"Not only the lecturer, I talk alot with your tutorial instructor! they actually have directions on how to plan and unfold your essayBasic chinese culture and values stuff...if you studied hard in DSE chinese...it's not much of a problem coz most of the values are about Ru Jia...Dao Jia...and it only requires introductory level of understanding so....very easy to understand...and in other perspective...it's quite useless lollectures are boring...although they will count attendance but i still skipped lots of lectures..."
442,"the tutorial session is more interesting coz you gotta discuss with your groupmates..it's quite fun to have philosophical debate while meeting classmates from all around the world...yet...the teaching sucks...I think it was L2 but im not really sure. It was about Chinese/Western philosophy - it covers utilitarianism, kant, daoism, Confucianism and many more. I actually enjoyed the content mainly because I like to learn about philosophy and understand some of human's intrinsic way of thinking. Some of the case studies were actually quite interesting.Poor english... Very boring teaching style. But he really tries to engage students in the lecture and makes some funny jokes.Content isn't bad if you don't just hate reading. It's not easy, but variable stuffs are thinkable; it's not a big deal to complete all the graded materials.It depends on who you meet, but I didn't have strong feeling of enjoying the lessons.Nothing has to be done heavily. Just spend enough time on the assignments and quizzes. But the essay has to be done with effort. Do not just take it easy with tutorial class; be aware of what your essay scorer requires. Keep trying until you and your scorer both satisfies with your essay is the key to get a relatively high score no matter how you mess up your other graded stuffs.It might be heavy if you are a really slow reader, or a reading hater. The content is not heavy but just suggests some thinking if you don't want a mundane stuff on your essay. I had no hard time with it when I spend just a little time on it whenever I am not busy.The course mainly about language and a small amount of Hong Kong background. Normal students have no difficulty understanding the ideas and concept behind. The only problem is the content is too long and boring for most of the students.It can be seen that the lecture wanted to interact with the class. However, her teaching was quite boring, everyone was sleeping or doing their own stuff in class.L1:  Language, Communication, and Society"
443,"This course will mainly talk about the topic of language, like how can we acquire a new language or is there a language exist in other species."
444,"Remember to choose L1,L2,L3 carefully because they have different topic and you may find it boring if u dont choose it wisely.To be frank, the lecturer is quite boring because basically she just follow her PPT. But I do feel that the lecturer tried to interact with us and create a better atmosphere."
445,"Also, you are required to attend the writing workshop in order to teach you how to write a good essay.The content is quite boring. Some people may claim some topics and lectures are the 'traps'. However, I think the course has a uniform grading system among all topics. There were three lecture sections and you can randomly choose one (or just the one that you like the most). It does not affect the final grade at all. Course content is fair but a bit boring.The class is conducted in LT and there are over 200 students in a class. There is no need to answer any questions in class. Of course, you can skip all classes except on the quiz days. There were two quizzes (10% of the whole course) throughout the semester. Make sure you are present on those days."
446,"For the tutorials, you MUST be present every time. It counts towards the tutorial performance (20% of the whole course). Remember to answer as many questions as you can, especially at the beginning of the course. As your tutor is rumored to be the one who marks your final essay, fighting for a better impression could bring you a little advantage."
447,"The MOST IMPORTANT point: Before handing in the final essay, you are required to do your first draft and submit it to the tutor. DO IT SERIOUSLY so that you can ask for very valuable advice from your tutor. After you receive the feedback, you MUST correct your draft ACCORDING to the tutor's advice. That can guarantee a good mark for your final essay (50% of the whole course).Topic: Language, Communication, and Society."
448,"I find this topic comparably more interesting than other HUMA 1000 http://lecture.It discuss language acquisition,differences in male and female languages, languages in Hong Kong."
449,Lectures tend to be boring.Mostly similar with the content in her powerpoint slides.
450,She tried to interact with student and involve students by using PRS.
451,"5 minutes break,usually after the 1st hour of lecturestuff like individualism, family in 80s, utopia"
452,"take this course for fulfilling the school requirement only.i never listen to the professor because i am not interested in the topic discussed, I was doing revision on other courses/hea throughout the whole semester."
453,"But looks like the professor tried to engage the class, but it's difficult for a big class (3XX people), and she welcomed questions and asked if we had any suggestions after quiz 1.The L1 lecture is about the the relationship between pleasure , happiness and good life and the meaning of life. It is much easier than others topics in the L2 and L3. However,   It is a bit boring for the lecture.There are lectures , workshops and online video for you to learn the theory of happiness.It's basically about some Chinese value, some already covered in secondary school if you are a local DSE student. But it is quite weird and adds a lot more workload studying Chinese materials in Englishthe prof. 's tone is quite flat but in a big lecture hall he doesn't really care what you are actually doingI feel the content was actually quite interesting. For me it was about- ""Is there life after death?"". As I am a religious individual, the contents were very interesting.The teacher tried to deliver the materials but it was not at all clear. It also did not feel that he was not trying to even look at the audience and was very difficult to hear.Super good grade for me. That's because I've studied English in an international school. Since a large % of the grading is based on just one essay, I found it rather easy.Workload was fairly light. No midterms or finals, just one essay. So it was good!The course is about some philosophical theories and Chinese literature stuff. It is particularly difficult to understand the content of Chinese literature part because the content is translated into English but the translation is quite weird. For local students, I suggest you look for the Chinese version of the content online."
454,"At last, students are required to write an essay about one of the questions set by the instructor which accounts for 50% of the final grade.Prof. Nam tried his best to teach but his teaching style is monotonous. Not many students listen to him during lessons. But he allows students to submit essays to him before the final submission date for checking then he would make modifications to the draft.This section of HUMA1000 will Introduce different ethic concepts. Western and traditional Chinese concepts like Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Confucianism and Mohism."
455,"The main point of HUMA1000 will be the tutorial section which you should not miss anyone of them.The professor is not really good at speaking English in my thought, so there will be difficulties understanding the contents of the course (at least for me~)."
456,"Moreover, most of the topics mentioned are so boring that one will easily fall asleep if he is lack of good quality sleeping or not concentrate enough. Fortunately, the lectures are basically useless since you can refer to the teaching notes and have self-study by yourself.Easy course. Good to take if you have a stressful semester and want to balance it off. The tutorials and lectures are completely different. The workshops are called writing workshops that basically teach you what your final essay should include and how it should be written.Teaching is fairly good. Material is easy so not much to understand.It is the only SSC-H course, which means that it is compulsory."
457,"The theme and content of the course is different for different lecture. As you are required to spend a whole semester on one essay title, it is suggested that to choose the topic that interests you, or you are familiar with."
458,Remember to attend all the writing workshop.My lecture and writing workshop instructor for that semester are Shengqing Wu and Ellen Yik. Both of them are good enough as they give clear instructions on what the course expects and how to achieve those expectations.
459,"Prof Wu played some movie clips to raise our attention, and have interaction with students."
460,"Ellen is willing to respond to questions and the atmosphere of the class is casual.The content differs a lot between different instructors. For my instructor, although her lectures covered many aspects including east and west, the quizzes were mainly about Chinese culture. Therefore, a good background knowledge about Chinese culture is quite crucial for her section.The lecture covered quite a lot of content, but the discussion at the end of each lecture seemed pretty awkward. With many students leaving the LT after taking the PRS attendance and most left remaining silent, it was really embarrassing. The tutorials, called ""Writing Workshop"", had little to do with the lecture, but mostly taught how to write the final essay.No CommentL1: Each section of the course has different main theme to be covered. Here are the areas of topic being discussed:"
461,"1. Pleasure, Happiness, and the 'Good Life'"
462,2. The Meaning of Life
463,3. Self-Interest
464,4. Moral Conflict
465,5. Cultural Relativism
466,6. Utilitarianism
467,7. Are there absolute moral rules?
468,The topics explained through powerpoint presentations by the professors and individual assigned reading will then be used to write a term essay with the following titles:
469,1. Analyze the possible meanings of the ¡°good life.¡± State your own conception of the good life and why you think it is good.
470,2. Would you agree that all human actions are ultimately motivated by self-interest? Provide reasons for your agreement/disagreement.
471,"3. On page 18 of The Elements of Moral Philosophy (Ch.2), James and Stuart Rachels provide the following argument against Cultural Relativism: ¡°In some societies, people believe the earth is flat. In other societies, such as our own, people believe that the earth is spherical. Does it follow, from the mere fact that people disagree, that there is no ¡®objective truth¡¯ in geography? ¡­Similarly, there is no reason to think that if there is moral truth everyone must know it. The Cultural Differences Argument tries to derive a substantive conclusion about a subject from the mere fact that people disagree. But this is impossible.¡± How conclusive is this argument against Cultural Relativism? In what sense may Cultural Relativism be valid?Professor Chong has a really soft and monotone voice. He also does not have much engagement with the students, thus making the overall lectures to be quite boring and easy to fell asleep. The topics being taught by the Professors in class would mostly be based on the assigned readings given."
472,"(Note: Better to read the assigned readings before hand to allow you to follow the lectures easily)For L2, it is mainly about Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Daozi, Tian Ming etc., which I found them abstract. There are one powerpoint, some reading materials and key point notes for each lecture.Dr Nam has relatively poor English. It is easy to fall asleep during the lectures with his monotone. I almost fell asleep every lecture. Overall quite boring.I did the L3 course in fall semester and the content of the course is about how western and Chinese philosophers view the idea of ""self"". It is obviously an interesting debate but, you probably don't need to know everything from the course for the ultimate essay.The teaching of the lecturer is to be quite frank, boring.Materials are all very accessible on canvas in preparation for the 2 quizzes and 1000 word essay of the course. Basic concepts such as Utilitarianism and Kantian ethics as well as abstract concepts like the good life are covered. In general, a very standard humanities course that is compulsory to all students.Professor lets you out an hour early for each lecture so it is quite chilled, but he is retiring after this semester so this section doesn't matter.Just another writing assignment. Not much to learn really, the topic of the essay is quite boring.Very casual, nice instructor if you pay attention.  Sometimes boring.Grades are not bad if you revise ur essay according to the instructors comments and pay attention in tutorials. Easy to get a good grade if u hv a stronger english foundation.If ur lucky you get a instructor tht doesnt check hr hwk rafh tutorial, else theres a simple task every werk you need to do. Not difficult but annoying.Content:"

Western moral theories: kantism...interesting ethical Deliemma.Easy to follow and workload was moderate.Relatively fair.50%essay,20%participation of writing workshops,10%online discussion, 20% 2 quizzes. The essay was important, since it took up half of the grades. However, the requirement for grammar and article writing was not too strict because it is a common core course that is offered for all university students including year one.Workload was fine, although online discussion and writing workshops must be paid careful attention to every two weeks. It's not hard to get most of the mark if you follow the instruction of TA and the workshops intructors.About Chinese philosophy and part of western philosophy. The content is quite related to daily life and not very hard to understand as a local student.Dr. Nam is a very good prof. who always jokes in his lessons. Yet, he has a not very good accent. Non-local students may find it difficult to understand at some point. Overall speaking, His teaching is very good for locals but not for non-locals.Talk a lot of psychological theory, If you are interested in these kind of stuffs. It would be a good choice to you.Very boring, very very boring. I feel sleepy every lectures. Tutor 1hour per 2 week. Tutor taught you how to write the essay.very subjective, grade depends a lot on your essay. You should choose the right topic to write your essay, otherwise difficult to get a good grade. At least, My friends and me choose the same topic and get a bad grade.not much, only essay and 2 quiz. online workload about 15 min per weekmy topic is about linguistics.the instructor in the lecture is quite dull, her accent kinda weird, but the in the tutorials is quite fun and friendly, he provides lots of useful and practical informationit's not difficult to get a good grade if you attend all tutorials and show willingness to improve your essays. listen carefully what your instructor in the tutorials says because that really helps.no heavy workload, and as the tutorials would update your process, it's not so difficult to hand the essay in on time.Interesting stuff if you are into philosophical ideologies. Lecture covered contents such as Kantian Ethics, Utilitarianism and etc. The writing workshop provides notes and tips into writing the final essay that you have to submit.The lecturer was pretty boring and his voice projection was not clear enough, so much so that people in the back half of the lecture theater could not hear him. Most of the people that do choose to turn up to class usually do whatever they wish to do."
490,"The writing workshop is a little more informative, with only 10 people to a session. This helps the instructor have more attention towards each student and allows for a comprehensive teaching.No CommentSome of the content are interesting and worth listening. But the length of lectures is a little bit long and most of the students are either falling asleep or watching youtube. The lectures are boring but it is alright to skip them, but there are will be PRS in the lesson.No CommentLearning about philosophy and humanity related historyProfessor has failry minimal volume of voice, at first, you can barely hear the speaking if you sit at the back of the lecture room. However, you will realize his monotone teaching is relatively helps you to fall a sleep.Interesting topics revolving around life and philosophyA really nice old man from Singapore"
491,"However his monotone teaching can definitely cure insomnia, so skipping class is a better option perhaps!Content is interesting. Self-studying is good enough. Except for quiz, I never attain any class after 2nd lesson.Teaching is so-so. Professor's voice is way too low in lecture and I never hear a word."
492,"Winnie is okay.Good grade! As long as you hand in everything on time and follow their timetable, you wont get a poor grade.Pretty average. 2 quizzes, one essay(1000 words) with NO EXAM. I think it is worth spending time on the essay coz it count for 50% of the total grade."
493,"Again, do submit everything on time coz otherwise there will be mark deduction.The content of HUMA 1000 L2 was quite okay. it wasn't too heavy or too illogical. The readings were acceptably interesting and that made the quizzes much more bearable.The lectures may be boring but we just attend to obtain IPRS attendance. The tutorials aren't many so it doesn't take up too much time. However, can afford to skip 2-3 lectures in the semester but no skipping of tutorials.Our lecture topic was ""Righteousness, Destiny and Well-being"". We learned about Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Confucianism and Mohism  for the first few weeks (topics for in-class quiz 1), and then Daoism, concept of Tian and Ming, righteousness and destiny in Mencius, self-establishment and detachment in Zhuangzi, and the life of a man of virtue in the last weeks (for in-class quiz 2). The first few weeks of contents was not too bad, but I found it hard to understand the latter topics."
494,"Contents for the tutorial / writing workshops were fairly straightforward, and if you know how to write essays in English, you will not have much issues with it.Professor Nam had poor teaching, and I barely went to any of the lectures. His PPTs were also badly organized so it was hard for me to study the course contents by myself."
495,"Mr. William Lee had good English and teaching.Topic is happiness, morality"
496,Interesting
497,Course content is rich but u dun have to know them all because your essay wont cover them all. Just study the part which related to yr essay is enough.

500,"A common core which everyone must take, so enjoy it:)Though topic is funny, professor's volume is low, hard to follow in lecture.IMPORTANT"
501,"This course has 3 sections (L1, L2, L3) and each section has a completely different topic or theme, so what you learn in one section is completely different from the others. I suggest you check the topics of each section before selecting one, as they change every term/year I think."
502,"Mine was L1: Happiness, self-interest and morality. Basically about different philosophical theories and ideas, sometimes a bit boring, but it was a more general theme, unlike other sections which focused on particular philosophies like ConfucianismTeaching during the lectures was boring... Of 400 people in the lecture about 300+ were sleeping or watching movies/chatting most of the time."
503,"The instructor for the writing workshops was very good though. Very helpful and attentive, gives good, specific feedback at every step of the essay.Cultures and Values (L3): Morality and Emotions in Philosophy, Literature and Film"
504,"From the syllabus: (This course will explore the values of morality, love and beauty across diverse cultures in relationship to the individual¡¯s emotional well-being and chance to have a fulfilled life. We will address the following issues as reflected in a range of philosophical writings, literature, film and art: universal and culturally particular aspects of ethics and human nature; different conceptions of romantic love; as well as the appreciation of beauty and art.)You should expect the lectures to be boring and monotone. But the lecturer tries her best to make it fun and interactive."
505,"As for the tutorials, I was fortunate enough to have Amy Chi. She is very nice, assertive at times. But she gets the job done. She gave me solid suggestions and critical feedback on the essay draft which was important for me to get an A for this course.You have different content to choose but I think they all require little knowledge. Just try to pick for the one that seems more interesting or more popular professor will do. I previously took ""Happiness"" in this course and it included a lot of the philosophy stuff, trying to convince us about what is true happiness. It may seems quite boring though.Prof was not so successful in catching students attention to his lecturing, so the classes were always half-emptied."

512,"For the essay, I think the most important thing is to improve your essay by what your instructor had suggested.The content is quite boring. Basically you are using english to study chinese culture. But you may still learn some philosophical thinking from the course.The professor is teaching in monotone and it makes the lecture not that appealing to listen. He did always encourage students to present their ideas in lectures so you still have to get prepared despite the boring lecture.quite interesting. My lecture was about traditional Chinese beliefs, you can learn many interesting ideas raised by different Chinese or even foreign philosophers.interactive. He would randomly pick some students to answer questions.quite good but this depends on different tutors. When you follow instructions from tutors and attend lessons punctually, this will not be a problem.you will only need to write a short essay around 1000 words and take a video as your progress report. As compared to other SSC-HUMA courses, this is a really easy course.If you are interested in the topics, you will find it interesting. Topics generally include morality and values. For me, I think it is a bit boring.Prof is well-prepared for the lectures as he is familiar with the notes and the points that he would like to elaborate."
513,"TA is quite nice as well. She will teach you a lot about how to construct the final essay and may give you some useful comments for improvement.i think the content is quite ok, but may be a little bit boring to some students"
514,"some contents are interesting and not very boring. they may be useful in our final essay, but I  skipped most of  the Lectures as they are time consuming and i am not able to learn a lot in the class (because i studies chinese literature before, therefore, when talking about chinese traditional values, I will rather skip the class)if u are in the tutorial class of Mr John Fung, You are quite lucky, because personally, his class is interesting and not very boring.  I think tutorial classes are similar with Lang1002/Lang1003,teaching with videos and powerpotins.  "
515,"i think it  is quite ok, but may be a little bit boring to some students . i think not many things to talk about teaching as different tutors may have different methods. but personally Mr john fung is good in giving advice and the grade given by him is quite goodBasically, all of the students in HKUST have to take this course, as this is the only Humanities (Ssc) that makes sense and is reasonable, in a way."
516,"The content is usually more about life, happiness, why is it meaningful to have love, or daily-related problems."
517,"It may be interesting for those who like to read, or who like to learn more about the value of life.Pretty good, the professor knows the topic really well."
518,"He already published a book related to the topic about happiness, so he does not have any problems related to the teaching knowledge.Although i'm not mad into linguistics, I gave much attention to it. Its pretty interesting to learn about language systems around the world.Tutor is nice. He have clear speaking and active in tutorial. He gave solid suggestions and critical feedback on the essay draft. The workshop wasn't too much of a help in developing ideas, but gave you a clear outline of what's expected from the final essay. Professor is happy to discuss our individual essays with us out of class, which is very helpful.My topic: Morality, Love and Beauty"
519,"It's really important that you choose the topic (lecture session) that interests you the most. Many L1/L2 students told me they found the philosophy boring or hard but I really enjoyed most of my lectures.Most of the lectures are interesting. Professor explains things clearly. I believe she took a lot of time to prepare the lectures. She goes through the assigned readings during the lectures so it is quite frustrating when you have already read them on your own. I think the morality part is the best because the moral dilemmas are interesting. Professor is happy to discuss our individual essays with us out of class, which is very helpful."
520,"Personally, I think the first few workshops are not really useful. The later ones are more important for they give you clear examples of essay: what they are looking for.Sadly im not a fan of linguistics so it's only natural not to give much attention to it. Nonetheless ts still pretty interesting to learn about language systems around the world.Nice tutor, gave solid suggestions and critical feedback on the essay draft. The workshop wasnt too much of a help in developing ideas, but gave you a clear outline of whats expected from the final essay.Various topics on human nature and the views of well-known philosophers. Can be interesting if you like philosophy but it wasn't very engaging for me personally. You pick 1 topic out of the 3 to write an essay for.Extremely boring as the class is very long and the lecturer tends to drone on endlessly. The 10 minute break in between doesn't really help.Kind of boring. The professor tried to integrate quite some Chinese culture in the beginning part of the course, and it might be a bit difficult to understand for foreign students, so be prepared. Also, expect A LOT OF words in one powerpoint slides.Atmosphere in the lectures are ok. Sometimes it could get quite noisy but the professor calms the crowd down pretty well."
521,"Tutors in the writing workshops are patient and they teach pretty effectively.Morality and happiness, quite a lot of common sense, need to read the materials before lesson if you want to understand the lesson. If not, then you can just come to class to unprepared, but need to read through a lot to prepare for the quizzes later.The professor basically repeats what is on the ppt. Depending on lessons, he might ask students some discussion questions. not a must to answer.Moral Psychology, Justice and the ¡°Good Life¡±, providing tons of history and related self-materials for you to read with the lecture notes.Kind of boring because of the contents taught, impossible to be fun."
522,"The writing workshop is even worse, repeating certain contents of Lang1002 and Lang1003, instructor feedback somewhat useless to me. Instructor feedback is not useful and minimal.TOO much comparing to other courses::"
523,"assigned readings every week and writing workshop every other week and 2 quizes and 1 final essayHuman nature, war, meaning of lifeThe teaching is extremely boring, and basically useless. The only reason I go to lecture is the PRS, which counts randomly towards the final grade as 3% bonus.50% are contributed from the essay, so you have to work harder on it, although I did not and the grade turns out to be quite good (not A+, but at least A)"
524,"Beware of the grammatical mistakes, since the essay will be marked by both the professor and the writing workshop tutor, who is basically the LANG tutor.The workload is light; apart from the essay, only need to write something on LMES when a topic is over while everyone can bullshit a lot on it, no big deal; and a video presentation, which is about your essay progress, again, just bullshitting.The whole course is about Morality, Ethics.You need to write an essay for the course. Recommend for people who have good english skills.The instructor is pretty nice and good. She gave comments about your essay so you can correct it laterThe grading is not bad. Not as bad as other people say. As long as you finish all the stuff she gave you and attend the classes.You need to write an essay, and discuss with your group. She will give comments about your essay.There was a lot to read and learn on your own and if you wish to completely grasp the knowledge of HUMA 1000, there is a lot that you must understand. Other than that, it was quite interesting to know more about different moral values of multifarious ideological concepts; you will learn to conceptualize certain philosophies and ideologies and use it to support your argument based on things that you've learned.Honestly, the teaching methods were not as ideal, and the sad thing is that it would be rather hard for this course to improve on its teaching techniques. First of all, the lecture was rather repetitive as we as students were told to read up on the reference materials, then it turns out the professor was going to teach the same thing on the day of the lecture itself. The professor seems like an enthusiastic person as he is always fine with answering the students' questions. As for the tutors in HUMA 1000 tutorials, they seem inconsistent to a certain extent as the content of HUMA 1000 is rather broad and they themselves are not familiar with the final essay requirements.Week 2: Introduction"

His lecture was engaging many students, and the lecturing atmosphere was very good.The content was very general and easy to understand. It does not matter if you read a lot before the quiz because at the end you will resort to common sense.Teaching was extremely boring and slow. I always fell asleep or didnt go.The grading is fair. As long as your essay is done well and you do the tutorials properly, it should be easy to land an A range.The workload is really minimal. Just a tutorial once in couple weeks and one essay based on the topics you read in lectureBasic linguistic knowledge which requires some logical thinkingLecture"

533,"The writing workshop will guide you to finish you essay, so you will almost get your easy done by about 75% when all workshops are finished."
534,"The midterm quiz is all MC and not that difficult (no need to drill in the lesson material and readings), it is just related to some broad concept related to lesson material and reading."
535,"I  just glance through the readings before the quiz, but it is already enough (so dont spend too much time on readings).interesting but too brief."
536,"topics covered are wide range enough, making it a very nice introductory course."
537,"but the powerpoint slides are sometimes badly made, thus referencing to the required readings are necessary.tutorials are great, but not so for lectures.The content is very broad and rich, this course is very intensive in the point that the readings can't be finished in time.The workshops and lectures are independent. The workshop only focuses on your writing assignment, whereas the lecture focuses on your quiz, the quiz are both all mc. All lectures count attendance.The Course is quite good. The course is quite similar to Liberal Studies for HKDSE students. If you are very interested to News and Liberal Studies , i strongly recommend you to apply this course.This course discuss lots of news and cases from Hong Kong to the whole world.  Also, the course's quiz is easy, as the quiz only have 20 MC questions and do it in a lecture room without any seats arrangement . Although i got 19/20 in the quiz, the tutor did not like me much and i got only a C range.The teaching is quite good for the tutors and it is so similar to Lang lessons.not interesting topic if you are not really into literature. i personally found the class very boringprofessor is good but not tutors. my tutor was very negative. she did not checked my essay fully, which ended up with me getting very low grade in mock essay. i wrote opposite opinion, but she did not read my essay until the end, so she just said i do not have counter argument.mainly on identity issues this semester"

Plus the teaching is jam packed with people. I would prefer a classroom size much smaller for topics like this.The are 3 major topics in the course which are Identity, Contact and Conflict, and Justice and Resolution.Lecture: never attended the class so I have no comment."

The lecture slides didn't contain much information, photos and pictures are shown only.Boring in class, the instructor would stop frequently if somebody are chatting, and a 5 mins break would be provided in the middle of the classContent is really, really bad. No practical knowledge usable in real life."
549,"Lecture notes are only full of pictures and their sources. Even if I wanted to listen in the lectures, there's not much information that is useful.Initially thought that Lawrence was a good professor since he had a very good command of English, didn't need to refer to anything during lectures. Seemed to be a very knowledgeable guy who graduated from Harvard."
550,"As the lesson went on, this proved to be wrong. His lessons were really boring. (as expected of a HUMA 1000 course though so there's no blaming him)"
551,"My TA was Dr. Danyal and he was amazing. Relatively funny guy with a decent sense of humor. Although his writing workshops are a bit vague, he does a really, really good job at scrutinizing your essay and making sure that you do your best. He's the only reason why the teaching is a C and not an E.many topics like identity, religion, ethnicityOften people don't put enough emphasis on the topic of the Huma 1000 class - but I think this is incredibly important. I took it freshman year and this was by far the most boring class I have ever taken in all years until now.

Literally assignments feel like middle school. Not only are the assignments very easy and quick to complete, but they are graded easily apparently. I think everyone I know who took the course got at least an A-.Next to nothing. Final exam is a one page essay.

In tutorial, instructor taught us how to write an good essay. He also gave advice on your drafts which helped me a lot.Professor teaching is useful but maybe kind of boring. Tutor is also helpful and useful, it was quite interactive, and he gave useful tips on essay writing.The ideas and values of self, family, and society of Chinese and Western societies are the main topic of this course. For example individualism, Confucianism, the change of  social status of female during 60th.......She almost read the slide sentence by sentence only, very boring, I must fall asleep every lesson. Especially her voice is very very soft while the lecture is very big. But she is a patient and passionate professor, she is very willing to answer your question although her explanation may not be useful.Too harsh"
563,"different topics about ethics and morality are disucssed. many examples are given and try to stimulate us to think more from different perspectives and from a wider angle. some topics are quite hard to understand, you may have to look up extra information in internet. you will find your lecture more meaningful if you finish the assigned readings before every lecture. it will help you understand more.Quite BadThe year I took this class talked about lots of confucianism and some theories about happiness and sth like that. Lots of theories covered in the lecture.The teaching was not bad I think. The professor was a funny guy who talked lots of jokes in the class but the nature of the curriculum was boring.  Also, his English was terrible.actually you wont understand what the prof is talking about unless you really do pay a lot of effort and study hard. i barely go to lectures and ppts are very difficult to understandi dont know about lectures cause i barely attend them but tutorials are very usefulThe content is like using English to study Chinese Culture and thoughts. Be that as it may, some of the content may find is hard to understand.Mr. Nam is quite funny and devoted to the class but his English pronunciation still has a room for improvement.The mark distribution is good with only one essay, with some online activities and two quiz. After merely reading all the slides once, I can already get above mean for both of the two quiz.The workload is not that heavy.Pretty easy, Barely had to study for the quizThere were times when I couldn't understand what the Writing Workshop supervisor was talking about because his English was really bad.. His accent was an awkward mixture of the American and the Australian accent.. I hated it. Did most of the work on my own.I was in L2 which was Linguistics. It was okay, with the tutorials way more interesting than the lectures.The lectures were a complete bore, with the huge LT A filled with sleeping people.Easy A. Hardly any effort as such required. Anyway it is as good as a compulsory course, so not like you have an option to take it or not. But then, my English was good and I participated during the tutorial discussions, which must have helped me get the A grade.There is an essay which needs to be taken seriously as it probably decided your grade.My topic was about linguistics and language death. To my surprise, the course was quite informative and sometimes intriguing. I was even able to use so of the knowledge in other SA common core courses. However, the info can sometimes be boring to people who have no interest in languages.The prof is quite monotone so many students did not pay attention or respect her during lecture. However, I think she's a decent professor since she gave comments and advice to students regarding to the essay.Morality, Utilitarianism......Cultures and values. Such as democracy and Confucianism.Lectures: Really poor. Makes the audience sleep all time."
564,"Tutorial: Did not give guidance to the writing. Simply read out the notes that is prepared.Content may be interesting to some, or not to anyone. I just remember watching films and videos all day when attending the class. We watched Blade Runner, Wall-E, Life of Pi, etc. Therefore, hardly any content at all. Honestly, don't be brainwashed by the content: it's too opinionated.Tutors are especially nice, to the extent that there is no need to force yourself into ""yo-ing"" them. Just answer questions and you'll be fine."
565,"The Professors suck. All you have to do is to listen to their crap, which to be fair is their BS which you can listen and dump. All in all, their teaching is pure BS and too biased for one to treat them seriously.Very rubbish, useless at all. Actually I did not understand what the Professor taught every lesson. My section was about linguistics. Basically all contents are boring and meaningless.The lecture is useless while 5 workshops are very important. The tutor in workshop will distribute the grade. Attendance is also needed in every workshops.You might have a more profound thinking about your life. But for me, i don't think so. Still, I have learnt something from the content.The lectures were very boring and I skipped them quite a lot. The assigned readings somehow helped me to catch up.Grading was fine. I have attended all the tutorial lessons and handed in the work on time. Also, I was doing quite bad in my draft essay. But, the grade turned out to be fine at the end, which was out of my expectation.Not much workload but it requires us to upload a video and just one final essay. And, there are some PRS things.This course investigates the ideas and values of self, family, and society to better understand the mutual impact of society and culture on individuals, and of individuals on society and culture in the modern world. We will examine the above topics reflected in a variety of modern Western and Chinese philosophical, literary, cultural and filmic texts, from which to explore how the self and its relationship to family and society are conceptualized and defined in both Western and Chinese cultures. While examining how the concepts of self, family values, and social responsibilities are framed differently across the course of history in the West and China, this course also devotes attention to the interaction and appropriation of these concepts from the Western context into the Chinese context from comparative perspectives. Throughout, this introductory Humanities course aims to stimulate students to critically contemplate on their own conditions as modern individuals in the contemporary globalizing world.Teaching material is simple and easy to understanding with powerpoint & tutorial notes.its good to know. philosophical ideas. maybe helpful later when you have to consider about ethical issues.its good. but, there are so many people who are doing their own things. so hard to focus. its a huge class with 200 people.they give really good grades i think relative to endeavour that I put innot much things to do (essay. done. one quiz). But it requires deep ideas. you have to think a little. they do PRS, check attendance. the class is 1hour and 50 minutes, quite long.Content is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeContent is awsomeSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingSo as teachingextremely boring, the professor just read the ppt himself and we learnt nothingbroken grade, i dun know why they can give such a low grade even i've fulfilled all the tasks.

He provided some reading materials and conducted few discussions in class.Sometimes will change from English to Putonghua to explain some terms. Very clear explanation.Grading is not bad since it is a small class. You can use Chinese or English for your assignment and exam.

571,The essay is weighted 30%

579,"WarlordThe professor is interesting, not that boring for a history class. He will deliver lecture notes in every lectures, but I recommend to jot notes by yourself.Teach you about detailed knowledge of western painting. The content includes the painters in different times, their works, their styles and it also requires you to identify and memorize ALL OF THEM, including the spelling. If you really like it, then just go for it; If you are not, then please don't hesitate to drop it!The teaching is very bad. The instructor's accent and tone are too strange for me to understand. I barely attended her course.These are the contents for this course:"
580,Greek Vase Painting
581,Roman Wall Painting
582,Byzantine Art
583,Illuminated Manuscript
584,Gothic Art

591,Pre-Raphael
592,French Realism
593,Impressionism
594,Modern Art
595,"First few topics are relatively easy and there are not much things to memorize. But as you get to medieval and renaissance period, you will have to memorize different painters with names that I can hardly even pronounce and paintings that all look quite similar for me."
596,It gets relatively better at impressionism and modern art.
597,"I took this course just to satisfy my common core requirement, and I regret taking this course without having any knowledge or information about western paintings."
598,I will recommend you to take this course only if you are truly interested in this area and know a lot about western paintings.Anna is very passionate in her lectures.
599,She is also very kind and caring to students.
600,"However, her way of teaching is slightly boring. Also,  you should go to all of her lectures or look at the lecture videos since you won't get a good grade by just looking at the ppt slides.2 midterms (30% each) and 1 final (40%). Questions are true/false, MC and short questions. The course is mainly about the style and technique used by painters from different periods, from ancient Greek to modern pop art. The course will test your understanding on different techniques and styles.Instructor is passionate in teaching Western paintings and encourages student to visit art museums. She is helpful and very willing to answer students questions. Teaching is good but there's still room for improvement.A brief picture of western painting. Though it sounds quite a long period of time but Anna only chose 15 period for introduction."

616,Some period did go quite deep as it is long and famous. But some period Anna only use a few slides for introduction.Anna is a good instructor. She's very nice and open to all questions. She did ask questions in the lectures to allow us to think more and analysis more.
617,"She is also multilingual but the problem is her voice is a bit low so it's quite easy to sleep in class. But she did upload the lecture videos online so you can always do review whenever you get lost in her lectures.Don't take the course if you're not very interested in western painting / or you have bad memory (there are people who get 30/30 for each quiz, you can't compete with them). You get insights to some famous, some less famous artists, and about 3-8 of their paintings."
618,"She uses a lot of jargon so you should keep the glossary she hands out because at first, most words are latin and french etc.She goes into a lot of details. If you like art you'd find her interesting. If you don't, you'll probably end up falling asleep or focus on her groggy voice. She posts her lecture videos online so I really like that."
619,"However, she made threatened us to go to the Monet art exhibition saying that there would be a question on it in the finals. There wasn't. (worth it but still.)Basically every important type of painting, with examples, that appeared in the West from ancient Greek vase painting to Andy Warhol.  Extremely comprehensive and informative if you really are into western painting.  Gives you a detailed overview of western art with some background history.  Anna also explained painting styles and techniques with a considerable amount of jargons (no, the majority of them are not English words).  "
620,"I personally find the course not that challenging, but you'll need a good memory to score better than others in her quizzes.  Trust me, you'll always find someone who remembers everything and gets full scores, and some who choose not to remember a single word then get shitty scores."
621,"The good news is, exams (or quizzes, the way she called them) are NOT accumulative.  In other words, 3000 years of western painting is divided (not equally) into 4 quizzes.Anna is a great lecturer.  Multilingual and extremely knowledgeable.  She explains things clearly and analyzes paintings not only from the aesthetics, but also from socio-economic conditions, history, religions and politics."
622,"But the main problem, as JC mentioned in HUMA2680's review, is her unidirectional way of teaching.  You'll need to take tons of notes and be very focused to get the most out of her lectures (and yes, she'll include all those small things you thought you won't be tested on in her quizzes).1. Quite disappointed as the course not too focus on listening ""classical"" music composed by famous composers such as Chopin, Lizst, Mozart, Debussy. Many of these famous composers only cover with 1 or 2 pieces."
623,"2. Personally think too much time talking about Drama, Opera. Maybe others like watching dramas, but not me. It would be best if a new course can separate Instrumental music and Drama."
624,"3. Nearly 40-50% of the time of the whole course talking about music around the Middle Age, medieval period and Renaissance. To be honest, those music are EXTREMELY BORING, i can hardly distinguish the period of those songs. Those Church songs are really not my cup of tea, many of us sleep during the class."
625,"4. A few interesting style of music are covered during 20th centuries. But i am really really unsatisfied as JAZZ, BLUES and not covered at this course."
626,"5. The  course can really change the way I enjoy music, the background of the composers, the story behind the piece, basic techniques of music, it open a new for me enjoy music.I like Tommasini. I can see he really put effort on this course. He does the  preparation well, often provides information more than the powerpoint. Sometimes he would ask us to learn basic   music techniques, such as singing and clapping. Really relaxing during the course.Content covered from the Dark Ages music to 20th century music, including operas, symphonies and etc."
627,"For me, music from the Dark Ages to the Romantic Period is not bad, but those musical works from the 20th century are really disaster, such as ""Come Out"" by Steve Reich."
628,"Not any music background is required, but it will be better for understanding the content if you have."
629,-
630,"And you will listen to Dies Irae from the first class to the Romantic Period, Tommasini loves Dies Irae soooooo much !For me, Tommasini is quite boring, i just go to class for attendance and do my own stuffs during classes."
631,-
632,"Usually the first 30mins of the classes are talking about those irrelevant stuffs from the content, like ""XXX concert will be held in HK on DDMMYY"", ""self-test X will begin at tonight 8pm, remember to finish it before it is ended, if you have any problems regarding the self-test, contact Rod before the self-test period is ended"".Study a myriad of songs across all generations since medieval, remember 50-70 songs' background, information are needed for midterm and final exam. People with basic music theory can get advantage among the class.Excellent professor with passion and his teaching is very easy to follow.This lesson is about music history from the dark age to the TWENTIETH CENTURY ART MUSIC, With a wide range of music.Lesson are interesting if you know how to enjoy music."
633,"However, many people may find it quite boring insteadEvery point in the power point will appear on the test and mid term and final."
634,He could ask you anything from content of the opera to the name of the composer.

651,"Students without any classical music background may find the musical works in medieval/renaissance/20th century a bit strange but you should be able to understand. Basic musical terms will be introduced but they are really basic, I mean you won't find it difficult to answer the questions regarding musical terms or knowledge in midterm or final.Professor has great presentation skill and knows where to make fun. Therefore, you should be able to focus in lesson  at 9am LOL"
652,"He did play piano in every lesson so it may be something attractive for you to attend the lesson (Also PRS)Throughout the course you will learn a wide range of music and songs from Middle Ages to the twentieth century, from instrumental music to dramas and operas. Course content mainly focuses on the historical context and composition techniques of the songs. After taking this course you can really gain a basic knowledge about the famous classical music composers and their pieces, as well as some of the identifying compositional techniques across different historical periods."
653,"It's perfectly fine for you to take this course without prior knowledge in music.The professor is knowledgeable and experienced in teaching this course. He is a composer himself. His teaching is very clear and easy to follow. He also gives very clear guidelines on course assignments such as the online quizzes and concert report.The syllabus covers pieces from the dark ages to the 20th century. Most genres of classical music would be taught. The stuff are quite interesting to be honest yet I think Tommansini has put too much emphasis on operas.Tommasini is great to be fair despite his fetish in opera and the boring Dies Irae. He creates a great studying atmosphere by singing, playing the piano etc.interesting and well organisedgood and inspiringabsolute grading scale"

670,I think it's VERY HARD to get A or A+ for a person who has never studied music before and knows little about classical music.The online quizzes are very easy and have a long time limit.
671,The exams are quite similar with the quizzes. But they are harder because they are closed-book with no notes. So be well prepared.
672,The attendance will be taken 10 times randomly through out the semester after the add/drop period.
673,"I think the concert report is not so difficult as it heard but it's not easy to get high score.Music ranging from medieval times to 20th century inclusively, with a variety of genres that you may know/not know about, including piano pieces, opera and other things. For those having musical instruments/piano background, they will find certain parts (especially those in Classical period) quite easy to handle."
674,"The pieces picked by this course sound good in general, but do note that some 20th century music may let you feel annoyed as you may not be able to adapt to those styles.Professor Tommasini pays a lot of effort and passion in teaching, and you will enjoy in the music played during the class. Sometimes he may also play the piano himself."
675,"As you may know, this course requires a concert report. Professor Tommasini will discuss some thesis statements during class to make students familiar of them, and he is willing to read and amend your thesis statement if you send him an email.Quite Broad since it is all about history."
676,A bit narrow for introducing composers and their backgrounds.
677,"I don't think it is a good idea for him to teach the nearly the whole music history and finish it. Instead, more details should be covered. It doesn't seem like you can learn things in detail."
678,"Personally, I don't think it is neither a well-made course nor a badly made course."
679,"For you music lovers like me, you may feel disappointed like me...Though you can still learn something. Definitely give a ""C""!Despite the fact that the content is not great and grade is quite harsh, you can feel the royalty/power of music. You can really love music if you enjoy his teaching."
680,"Though, professor arrives just on time, and makes announcement + PRS for more than 20 minutes, once 35 minutes!!! This makes me feel disappointed."
681,"He has taught well, and Powerpoint is well made.  However, the time management of class teaching is not so well done..."
682,"He explains the concert report and uses student example with his revision very detailed and clear, which is one of the greatest things I learn from him."
683,"Anyway, you can really enjoy music since you can listen to a few listening videos each lesson and you can sing or clap in some of the lectures."
684,SIT in the front if you love music!
685,"Professor is not happy about people being noisy at the back. Pay your RESPECT!If you are a classical music lover, then the course is perfect for you. Very interesting content. The professor added in some fun facts about each composers, so that the course would not be only about the music they composed.The professor is humorous and is very passionate towards teaching. He is willing to answer any questions raised by students, either during lessons or in the email. He also talked about these question in class, so that everyone could think about the answers.Too many content even for a student who know about classical music. You have to memorize whole trend of music and even be able to recognize the song. Too hard!!he just talking on his own. But basically you can follow if you try very hard. And he will take attendance radomly. Also you even have to attend some additional talk to get the credit!This course talks about the 4 periods in classical music which are Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Twentieth Century periods. The professor will start with music from the Dark Ages first, and it's better if you understand that since he'll use this period for references in the future."
686,"He'll talk about the composers, how an excerpt of a piece of classical music differs from or resonates with another, and how to spot the differences so we can know what piece is from which period. The professor will repeat those three anyways, so if you attend the lectures and really listen then you'll be able to get it."
687,"He posts lecture videos, too, so if you were absent from a class you could just go on Canvas and then watch the video from there, although he sometimes uses iPRS to take attendance without prior notice so you have to be on the lookout for that.He's easy to understand, comprehensive, and doesn't stray away from the bullet points in his ppt files. Even if you don't listen to his lectures, you can still study from ppt files so there's no way you'll flunk this course.The content before mid-term is quite easy to handle. However when it comes to the final exam, the musical periods are much sophisticated.He has to teach so many musical history that his lessons are not usually on schedule. But sometimes the instructor demonstrate the musical ideas and terms by playing piano, which is quite interesting.introducing different pieces of classical music and musicians from Medieval period to 20th century."
688,give you a big picture of those period.
689,***use some memorizing techniques to help you remember all the songs and musicians! maybe non-stop loop can helpQuite good.
690,"He provides lecture videos on canvas.Many contents, including music from the very early age to modern music. Very broad, and includes a lot of information but it is still interesting.He is pretty calm but passionate instructor."
691,"He's teaching is interesting and he tries a lot to bring student's attention.If you memorize all the music and things from the material, you will be fine. But the attendance is very important in this class, as well as the result of three (? or five, I cannot remember right now) tests, which you need to do it at home.I think the workload is average."
692,"As it is 1000's course, it doesn't require too much works.The lecture covers practically everything from the beginning of Western classical music to the 20th century. Some things like Dies Irae keeps popping up between the centuries, which is understandable given the universal usage of the motif throughout the centuries. The music may not be to everyone's tastes but they were adequate representations of the important themes in those time periods.Professor Tommasini is a very spirited instructor, who is also very knowledgeable and prepared for all his lectures. He also does his own compositions which were nice to hear during one of the concerts. One of the better professors at UST.As a fan of classical music, I found this class extremely interesting and informative. Tommasini went through the history of music from gregorian chants to contemporary music, and taught concepts by presenting songs for each period. I enjoyed that he explained the history of famous composers as well.Tommasini is a fantastic professor who is obviously very passionate about classical music. I found him extremely engaging and enjoyed hearing him explain musical concepts and history.Week 1 Introduction; Medieval Music"

710,"Week 13 Contemporary Art Musictommansini tries his best to make the lecture to be fun, he asked us to stand up and sing in different parts or clap our hands with the beat"
711,"he always promotes some concerts for you to listen for our concert reports and talk about the rules and examples of concert reports during the first 15-30 mins of each lecture, which I think is quite boringContent is heavily focused on pre-classical music (e.g. the lesser known Middle Ages, Medieval, and Renaissance music), but does cover all the way up to contemporary. Does a fair job of covering the extensive material but minimizes importance of a lot of the composers we tend to perceive as classical."
712,"Also, incorporated way too much information about opera when there is an entire class for Opera.Enthusiastic teacher. Tried to engage the class a lot at the beginning, which I did like. But every lecture is formatted exactly the same, and with so much material, it can get quite repetitive very quickly.contents cover different periods of classical music e.g. history, characteristics ..."
713,super easy to understandthe pace of teaching is fast

725,"most of the course was talking about history and little about music theory. so it's okay if you do not have any musical background.the instructor's teaching is very clear, and he use ppt as his teaching material and is willing to answer question.The course covers the history of music from the timeline, with the four musical periods. Professor strongly asserts the importance of Dies Irae, and asked students to sing along.Professor Tommasini can explain all the concepts and musical terms clearly so all of us understand. The lesson is also quite interactive, as he may ask students to sing together for a song, or clap some metrical patterns. Good for the ones who love watching all kinds of concert vids and performances since they will be played all the time.begin with diesirae and end with diesirae."
726,music history + composers + a list of songs + theory
727,just loop the playlist before your examquite interesting tbh if you like singing and music .Informative
728,More like history course than music:
729,It will cover several periods of music history
730,Not hard to digest
731,Better with some knowledge to read musical notes
732,Contemporary music is interesting and challenging( It annoys ears)Some jokes while teaching
733,But mostly just read the power point
734,great use of music and video
735,Matthew is such a very talented pianist that you will enjoy his play
736,Sometimes student will be divided to sing different parts of a harmony which involves interactions which can keep you awake
737,Matthew will always spend a lot of time to introduce recent concerts or musical event in UST and Hongkong. They are helpful for you to find a concert to attend since it is required to take one and it's your material to write an essay about.
738,It's better to register a concert on campus at the start of course because you may find trouble booking a seat later on.(And it's expensive to buy tickets for concert outside the school and you also need to take traffic into consideration)
739,"Matthew will also analyse some essays, which is helpful for students to come up with a topic to write about.Covers Medieval, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and 21st Century music. Quite intense...... (I heard music majors cover all these periods in 4 years... while we are doing this in one semester... Professor Tommasini is quite ambitious I guess)"
740,"I wasn't a huge fan of the Medieval and 21st Century music, so the content was a little boring for me. Professor Tommasini is American, so I guess that explains why he taught so much on American music... (I was wondering where Enjoyment of ""Classical Music"" went)"
741,The format of content taught goes like this:
742,1. period
743,2. special feature A/B/C
744,"3. several music piece as examples to reflect special features A/B/CProfessor Tommasini prepares class thoroughly and often starts lesson by repeating some content from the previous lesson. As long as you pay attention in class and try to memorise alongside his teaching (and not forget things), the content shouldn't be too difficult to study."
745,"(he always shhhhes people though, which I hated a lot because sometimes I don't even hear people talk but he shhhhes)Sometimes find it boring during the lessons. But you can know more abt different types of classical music.Quite good and funny.The mean of the course is quite high. People usually get full marks in online quizzes.There are online quizzes, concert report , 1 midterm and 1final. All u need to do for this course is to memorise the songs (instead of based on your knowledge and guessing the songs), also the background, the information of composers, coupled with the history of songs. Attendance is needed during lessons.If you have no basic knowledge on the piano keys or musical instrument, it may be a bit hard for you to pick up. History is also one of the content, but most important is your identification of the style of music.His lessons are interactive and he gives a lot of extra information besides the things shown in the powerpoint.It includes different periods of classical music such as"
746,"Baroque, romantic twenty century etc. Some songs are quite popular that you have definitely listened to it.Tommasinsi is very nice. He broadcasts all the songs he taught and this helps u familiarize with them.Boring contents, requires you to memorise everything for the exams which are meaningless. Not value adding at all.Poor teaching, feels like he is talking to himself during classes. Extremely boring, especially if your lecture is during the morning, then you will sure sleep in class.Poor grading. Full mark for all canvas quizzes, mean for mid terms and finals, missed attendance for 2 times. Finally got a D.A lot of reading of notes, too many words. Sometimes the naming of audio files are wrong which makes it even more difficult to revise or study. Quizzes almost every 2-3 weeks but the contents are meaningless.A concert is required for student to attend in Central. However, there is not enough seat for all the student on that day. Most of us just go there for attendance and do nothing which waste of time and super unfair."
747,"In midterm and final, you have to remember all the songs which is super hard for people who don't even listen to classical musicNot very outstanding teaching. No much interaction beside singingThe lectures cover almost the entire historical development of western music. The instructor begins with Middle Age music, followed by Medieval and Renaissance music. These musical eras only cover a small part of the syllabus. The main focus is on the common-practice period, which means the Baroque, Classical and Romantic periods. 20th Century music also possesses a significant part but the instructor may not go in depth."
748,The lecture slides introduce the history and culture of different musical periods and explain the characteristics of the compositions in the corresponding eras. A few examples of composers and their works will then be cited.
749,"Some musical theories, such as circle of fifths are included as well. Students have to be familiar with the manipulation of musical keys such as parallel and relative major/minor and dominant keys."
750,"The exams are likely to be precise and goes into details like the composers' nationality and the definition of musical terms.The lecture slides are very lucid, with a clear flow of ideas and explanations. However, there are still some questions on the slides that are answered neither on the slides or in the lectures. Another problem is the repetition of content. The instructor copies the slides that he has not covered onto the next slide. But overall the presentation is quite comprehensible."
751,"The instructor emphasizes a lot on the concert report and he sometimes spend 1/3 of the lecture to talk about the details. However, the way he delivers the messages is outstanding. It will not be very hard for students without musical background to understand. His enthusiasm and attitude towards music is conspicuous."
752,"Students must attend the Intimacy of Creativity Concerts as well as the discussion sessions but not everyone finds it interesting. Some of the students may not be able to appreciate the artistry and assimilate the communication between the musicians. The atmosphere of the discussion sessions is a bit awkward.background: music team in one of the best schools in terms of music in Hong Kong, USTUC ex-member"
753,"i still find the course too chur, since it covers from middle ages to contemporary music. the prof expects you to have some music knowledge (although not explicitly said so).the prof is passionate about music, that's for certain, but sometimes he can deliver in quite a boring way, in the sense that he expects everyone to know as much music history and theory as he does.very interesting, including from ancient time to 20th century"
754,very suitable to those who are obsessed with musicthe professor try to make the atmosphere more relaxing
755,but he only say the powerpoint stuff outabsolute grading
756,not many assignments
757,"have a few quizzes but open book, so it is very easy to get high score and getting A range"
758,there are midterm and final but if u can memorize all the things it is not difficult to get A
759,"including taking iPRS for 10 times, so it is better to attend the lessononly 1 concert report in fall sem"

763,History and basic musical knowledge are taught.   
764,Suitable for both types of students with or without a musical background.Prof is passionate about music and has a nice accent.
765,"I find his teaching very interesting but some might find it boring if they are not interested in music.It is better if you have a background in music, but it is okay if you don't have a background in music.If you are interested in music, you might like this course. The lecture is pretty clear and pretty interesting. You can access lecture video on canvas. The TA will provide youtube playlist before midterm and final.The course is about classical music from medieval, renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic period to the twentieth century."
766,"For each musical period, 5-10 songs will be introduced as examples, and these songs are exactly the content for exams."
767,"For each song, it is suggested to memorize the background, specific technique adopted and, most importantly, the composer and where the composer was born."
768,"Songs will be played in lectures while prof will explain and elaborate a bit on it. On powerpoint slides, there are links of the songs."
769,"Besides that, some musical terms will be taught, like texture: polyphonic and monophonic."
770,"Attendance will be taken for 10 times randomly through iprs. Sometimes attendance may be taken at the end of class, it may NOT always be taken at the beginning.Prof was really nice, he answered questions clearly on classes."
771,"He taught a bit fast, he always went through the slides quickly."
772,"But he always gave us exam reviews before midterm and final exam and sometimes questions on reviews would appear on exam paper. So, reviews are really important.The course introduces classical music from medieval, renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic period to the twentieth century. Professor will talk about different pieces for each period, in which around 4-5 pieces will be discussed for medieval and renaissance, and around 10-15 pieces will be discussed for the rest of the periods. For each piece, the professor will briefly talk about the author and the techniques used."
773,I found the content quite interesting as I knew more about different styles of music. There are many good pieces that I can still remember now.The professor tries very hard to engage the whole class by sometimes asking us to sing along and tap the beat of different pieces. He always asks if we have questions and answers to students' enquiries sincerely.Final Exam                40%

802,"Overall, it is interestingNot bad, try to provide the best education in the lesson."
803,"The professor plays several music and play the piano in every lesson, sometimes students may need to sing together. Haha"
804,"He like repeats the content of last lecture for students to review.This course covers a wild range of  music pieces from medieval to 20th century. Students will learn about basic musical terms and expressions, as well as backgrounds of composers.The professor emphasizes main point and repeats important terminology and content so you will know what to study. You can enjoy listening good music during the lesson as he play through them.For those who have no musical background, you need not feel worried. Assessment in this course EMPHASISES ON MEMORY BUT NOT YOUR MUSICAL CAPABILITY to answer the questions. For example, in the general question part, they ask you what form is Beethoven Sonata No.2 movement 2 in, without playing the excerpt. And for instance, in the listening question part, by just playing you a short clip, they would ask you the plot, characters' name and why they feel sad.I think this professor is able to convey musical knowledge to ones with no musical background. Also, if you miss his lesson, you can view the recorded lesson in canvas.Music from Medieval time to the 20th century."
805,Background of each piece and the composer.The professor is nice and he provided a lot of materials for mid-term and final.

818,"Attendance is taken 10 times randomly throughout the semester.In my view, Professor Tommasini tries to make memorizing things fun. Sometimes, we are asked to sing a short line of a song or clap to beats so that we remember the song. He also teaches musical concepts (e.g. circle of fifths) repeatedly to make sure that everyone, including those who don't have any music background, understands the materials. He also goes through some thesis statements for the concert report in class to help us get the idea of what he wants in the report.- History of music from:"

The professor emphasizes main point and repeats important terminology and content so you will know what to study.The content was very broad, covering from music in the middle ages all the way to modern music and including about 70~80 pieces of music to memorize. Also, each piece of music has 3~10 slides of information to be studied. For those who do not enjoy listening to music or lack genuine interest in classic musics, memorizing all those information for the exams can be tedious for some extentProfessor seemed to be very enthusiastic.

871,"Memorize everything on the ppts e.g. the city where the composer was born. Questions are direct though.super light workload but the concert report can be though coz have to include concepts and terms mentioned in the lectures.The lectures will cover from the Middle Ages to 20th Century music. For middle, medieval and renaissance periods, the learning materials are relatively less than the Baroque period's and onwards. Remember to listen to the works discussed in the lecture and memorise the characteristics related to these works. The lecture notes will be released before each lecture."
872,PRS for taking attendance will be done in 10 of all lecture throughout the semester randomly. Bear in mind that sometimes PRS will be taken at the end of the lecture so for those who leave the lecture early will lose some marks in attendance.
873,"The most tricky thing for this course is the concert report which should be handed in in the last lecture. You have to write a report after attending a concert and use musical theories taught in the lecture to appreciate the concert.The professor has a great passion in music and teaches well. Listening to classical music pieces in-class is an relaxation, especially the professor sometimes performs part of the work by his own.If you are interested in music history, this course will be good to you.The teaching of professor is not too fast, easy to catch up.  But it would be great if you understand a little bit of music, e.g. what is forte, allegro.If you spend time to recite all the names and songs, believe me, you won't get a bad grade.Sometimes just need to do the self test, and there's a concert report to be completed.  Not very heavy at all. There are some free concert that can be attended in ust, so don't need to worry about the tickets.The pieces taught in class are nice (except those from the 20th century). A few pieces are taught in one lesson.  Music theory stuff are not difficult. Only basic music knowledge will be taught.The lessons are interesting. Professor will play some pieces and ask the class to sing."
874,"TA is nice and helpful.Development of classical music from medieval to modern ages. Thorough explanations about the composers, characteristics of the piece, and a very little music theory.He explains really clearly about the contents, native english speaker, communicative, very descent overall.The content is very intense and music from the Middle Ages up to the 21th Century and Post-modernism will be taught. Do not expect to learn any practical skills from this course, this course is only designed for students to understand more about the history and development of music. As for the midterm and final exams, there is a substantial amount of materials you need to memorize, including the melodies and characteristics of every piece of music mentioned in the ppt, as there will be MANY questions in the exams where you will listen to part of a song and be able to pinpoint the composer, period, genre, composition technique, and the name of the larger piece it originated from.The professor is a very serious person, and often repeats announcements he thinks are important. Not much to say about his teaching because he just reads from the ppt and plays videos.The whole course consists"

886,development of vocal genres (including opera) and instrumental genres (including the sonata).

904,"(including ostinato complex, polyrhythm), harmony (including polytonality), and serialism as"
905,they relate to the works during this periodThe first 15 minutes is promoting the concerts going to hold. Professors would play the piano sometimes. But basically reading for the powerpoints. Skipping all lessons would be fine as long as you ask your friends to take attendance for you.Interesting course content
906,+ Just have to memorize everything on the slides and prof's comment.
907,Exams are quite tricky (and mean was usually high).
908,"Do not miss quiz + review quiz (some quiz questions came out in midterm/final exam)Good prof, very passionate about teaching classical music (sometimes play piano during the class)Testing how good you are memorizing Italian, German and French names of songs and composers. Hell you even need to remember the name of the architect who built something at the Brussel's World Fair."
909,"But you can learn a great deal about 20th century music (eg. impressionism/primitivism) which is seldom taught at middle schools.The professor has very good intonation and delivery skills. I just wish he stops spamming advertisements of concerts for about 20 minutes at the beginning of each lesson.Pretty much stuffs about Classical music in the Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and 20th century music, including prominent composers and their works."
910,"No prior music knowledge is required, it says. But actually they can be quite helpful in learning and writing concert report.For me, he's good. He cracks jokes once in a while. But his lectures can be quite boring sometimes.Very interesting.Was from time to time a bit boring and you need to attend the lectures all the time because he takes random attendance.Very nice. However, the mean is high, so you need to study if you want a good grade. :)Very light. All you have to do is going over the ppt slides before a few nights before the exam. There are a few online assessments but you don't need to get all of them correct to get the full score. As long as you finish them, you get the grade.Provides an overview of the development of classical music from its simplest stages in the middle ages to its complex and varied form today. Covers a huge variety of composers. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in classical music or music in general even.The professor explains things from the ground up for people with no musical background and often reviews content from previous classes at the start of the lecture to ease students into new content.classical music from different age medieval , renaisance, baroque, romantic, calssical20 century"
911,just listen music and some facts/background history of diferent age
912,need to do music report
913,attain intimacy of creativity(spring)
914,midterm+final

916,"if you wanna know what songs/music will be taught, just search huma1102 on youtube, then you can find playlist of all songs in the coursequite interesting, sometimes we may also sing togetherIt was rather useless for people who don't have any interest for classical music, really (a lot of people take this course just because of the good grading it promises)Prof. Tommasini teaches quite well, he tried to make things interesting (although he fails quite miserably sometimes). Lectures consist of him talking, video watching, and music listening.Overall: Good."
917,"The content is prepared in the form of ppt(in class)/pdf(on LMES). Detailed and well-organized, they are really excellent material for preview and review. Do NOT bother to buy textbook, for the professor will cover all the necessary content on the lecture."

937,Students without prior music background should be able to handle the course.
938,"However, students with some extent of music experience (especially those participated in an orchestra) may find the course even more interesting."
939,"Apart from regular lectures, students are required to REGISTER and ATTEND at least one CONCERT (on the approved list of the course) during the semester. Afterwards, a short concert report is required to be submitted at the last lecture."
940,Personal Comment:
941,(This would be the ideal case)
942,"Find a friend, you both have some extent of music knowledge."
943,Attend lectures together and laugh together which results in a happy semester.
944,"If you attend the course alone, you may be bored sometimes as some topics are rather plain and boring (e.g. ballet for me).The professor is extremely passionate in teaching and very willing to help students at any time."
945,"During lectures, the professor will sometimes ask the whole lecture to sing together. It is quite fun.The content include too many things that you are not able to memorize all before exam unless you just study for this course. You have to be able to identify more than 40 classical music pieces in final exam and have to be extremely familiar with the background of each piece. In conclusion, unless you want to be an expert in music history, do not take this course. Music background will not help in this course.He just read the power point.It covers the Medivial, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and the 20th century period. Characteristics of the pieces in specific period and the biography of composers will be discussed.The professor is friendly and nice. The contents were presented clearly in class. He also played musical pieces and sometimes videos to help you understand in class.The content is very thereotical, which covers a huge area of Classical Chinese. You have to jot down everything the instructor said during the lesson. Otherwise, it will be so painful to find out the meaning of the Classical Chinese. One good thing about the course is that it does not have additional reading materials other than the slides.The instructor is very experienced in this area and the questions he raised is thought-provoking so I would regard it as a spirit-nurturing course. His Putonghua is not native but you will have no difficulty in understanding his teaching.Works covered:"

999,"However she teach mostly through talking and discussing with students.  The discussion flow and the her points are a bit hard to follow for me, with some very breif notes( 1/2 sentences for one literary technique) and no slides.  You have to take notes for everythin you heard in class, no matter from the teacher or others, otherwise u will remember nothing to use in the essay or in the exam."
1000,"The TA is dispensable. He only took attendance.The course introduces basic concepts in linguistics such as consonant, vowel and morpheme and the method to analyze Chinese language. Moreover, comparison on the grammar and sentence structure between different languages would be covered.The instructor is passionate in teaching and helpful in answering students' questions. She also uses concrete examples to explain the concepts and this makes the theories easier to understand.Covers European history from 1914 to 1945, but centered around Germany, Italy and Russia, and their respective dictators - how Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin rose to power, what political happenstances enabled their rise, their regimes etc."
1001,Includes ample intriguing bits of history as well as deep insights into the intricate politics of the interwar era through the extensive readings.
1002,"Since the course content jumps from one country to another in mere weeks, and many of the historical events happened in intertwining manners, one may find writing up timelines useful.Professor Joshua Derman is a very nice professor who knows his course materials well. He is easily approachable and almost always answers should you have any questions concerning particular details, however irrelevant or unimportant they may be. If you met any troubles with the course, be sure to approach him."
1003,"However, he often had too much to cover in a lecture and could not finish all the lectures before study break (well to be fair he did miss two lectures due to family matters)."
1004,"I gave teaching a B because he often spoke too fast and you will have to take notes at law school speed; moreover, most of his sentences end unintelligible because he spoke in decrescendo every sentence.Extensive reading materials (two books) with ppt and notes (listen in class to fill up the blanks). Enjoyable and informative. Analytical, but exam focuses on memorization"
1005,"HELP:Amazing professor. Knows  his material. Interactive classroom. May get boring if you suffer from information overload near the exam-time.The content is what you would expect from the title of this class. The course is divided into three parts: Hitler's Nazi Germany, Mussolini's Fascist Italy, and Stalin's Soviet Union. The time period spans from the eve of WWI to the defeat of Axis in the WWII."
1006,"Each lecture contains about 20 to 30 pages of PPT that would be tested on the exam.The teaching is beyond perfection. In fact, this is the best course I have ever taken at HKUST. The professor knew his materials extremely well, and the contents were delivered in a very organized fashion. I would highly recommend anyone who is interested in history to take this class, as the teaching by itself is just fascinating.Content is ok I guess. Not bad. The course focuses on Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini but it's honestly not particularly interesting. It's literally learning about their entire lives starting from when they were born so there isn't much time to learn about the interesting stuff that we all wanna know."
1007,"If you're interested in learning a lot about the Holocaust and stuff like that, NOT THIS COURSE. BARELY TOUCHES IT.He's pretty boring not gonna lie. It's very ""lecture-styled"", aka he talks for the entire class and you copy notes. His voice is pretty monotonous but he'll sneak a joke in here and there.The content is well organised and presented. It contains the political regimes and social life during the reign of Mussolini, Stalin and Hitler; and less content about wars etc.Teaching is great. The professor is engaging and makes the lectures interesting.2 1.5-hour lectures per week. No attendance requirement. Lectures are video-taped with the condition that there is satisfactory class attendance. Covers background events leading to the rise of the three dictators and compares them.Fast-paced teaching. Covers more content than in the powerpoints. Likes to ask students for their views on the topic.The content of the course is super interesting if you're interested in European history, and the world war period.Prof. Joshua is very good. Keeps the class interactive and is very responsive to queries.Grading isn't too strict. Easy to get a decent grade if you keep up with the course content.Workload isn't a lot. Weekly readings are assigned, though they aren't compulsory, they are recommended for a better understanding for the course. 2 quizzes which were pretty straightforward, along with a mid term and final which are moderately tough.The content is really comprehensive and interesting throughout the course. It explores not only the history facts but also the backgrounds, people that causes the event.The instructor is keen at explaining and clear and concise. He stress not only on the key facts but the regimes of the three dictators, their philosophies and how different people's role, cultural factors which is quite thought-provoking.Although I had studied about these dictators before, I learnt a lot of new stuff through his course. It really changed my perspective about the two world wars and the cold war. This course helped me see Stalin in a new light.Definitely one of the best professors at HKUST.Endless boring contents, I took this course believing that I would learn interesting developments in the two world wars, but instead ended up learning about the background of the leaders. Well blame it on my not understanding the course objective or whatever, but it was such a dull uninteresting course.His teachings were alright, but the monotonous voice and boring ppt contents put me to sleep after the first few lessons. Almost 3 hour class twice in a week certainly doesn't help.This course is indepth and really interesting. The instructor is amazing.  Its important to go to every class though, and take notes but most students would probably reallly want to go to class as the subject itself is so interesting and mesmerising.Joshua is a great instructor and the follow of the class isn't dull in my opinion. He will also upload lecture videos by the end of term which is really helpful.A lot of content that is interesting but goes unused in your papers and on tests. Unique subject that gave me a greater appreciation for art but sometimes the lectures became a bit dull. Some students will leave the lecture after the quiz has been handed out, and many will not come if there hasn't been a scheduled quiz. The subject matter is actually pretty interesting in my opinion but others have found it to be boring. You learn a lot about different styles in ink painting and the influence of history on said styles.Flora Fu was extremely engrossed in the subject of ink painting and it was fascinating to go on that journey with her. She is a very sweet lady who no one in my class has ever spoken crossly about. She cares deeply about ink painting and sharing her passion with her students. She is always very patient with students and tries to help them understand the nuances of brush strokes or use of space.If you don't know the geography or time periods of China, or don't speak Chinese it can be a bit difficult to keep the content in order mentally. Plus, it makes it a bit difficult to do research for the individual paper and the presentation, as much of the content available online is in Chinese online. The class is taught in English though.Professor Fu is very dedicated to her work and it's clear she knows what she is talking about. Art is fairly subjective, so she is open to differing opinions. She offers many resources for the paper and the project, and she can direct you to the texts or journals that would be useful to use.Content of this course revolves around introduction of pop culture in HK, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Movies, pop songs, cartoons and TV drama will be discussed to help you understand more the difference between them.I like her way of teaching as she explains the concept clearly. Even if you dont understand, she is willing to help after class.I strongly recommend this course for Exchange students who want to know more about East Asia, and Full time students who feel that they lack knowledge about their background, or feel confused with their identity.Study the East Asian culture through movies, dramas, music, and some readings.I personally feel that this course covers a too long period (1800-1949) and a too big topic (the whole traditional society instead of a specific aspect), which makes the focus of this course a little bit ambiguous. each topic seems to be independent from each other and no way interconnected."
1008,the prof lists out many many topics at the beginning of the semester but doesnt really talk abt each of them. actually she prints out notes for students each lecture but seldom completes all the slides.
1009,"however this course teaches some methods to study humanity, and they can applied to daily reading. Overall i wont recommend this course but one can still learn something from it.It might be due to the limitation of language, I personally think the teaching is not very attractive. However she often gives much more information during tutorials and field trips when speaking chinese is allowed. But I have to say she is really nice and willing to help."
1010,"There are quizzes at the beginning of lectures sometimes, to help summarize the content of last lecture. the quizzes dont count into final grade but they are very helpful. i guess u wont miss much even  if u dont attend a class as long as u come earlier nd take the quiz next timeBoring lecture.  He simply read through the powerpoints.  you can get high marks without really paying attention to what he said.  Despite the fact that he claims attendance only accounts for 5%,  it affects much of your whole grade.It is mainly about old to modern movies and the history of movie industry.The instructor is really good. She is very willing to interact with the students.I think it's not hard to get a good grade. I have got around mean in the two quizzes and midterm. Not sure about the final essay. We almost have a full score in the group project but I don't think we have done particularly well.The workload is not that heavy, especially in summer semester. But there's a few readings every week and an online discussion after every lessons. I'll suggest you to read them if you are a movie lovers.The course talks about film industry from the earliest state in 1910s to present time. Each lesson the instructor will start with ppt slides talking about a period and then the other half of the class is just watching movies.The instructor is really nice and the film she chose is good.phonology (initials, finals, tones, phenomena)"

1015,"passionate in teaching, discusses a lot of interesting examples in class, can remember our namesA wide variety of topics relating to identity, community, power etc... About 1-2 weeks spent on each topic, and a new reading on every topic. These topics are not necessarily difficult, but they do challenge you to think, and many times you can easily second guess yourself.Professor draws attention of the class very well; participation and differing views from different students help make the content more interesting. She tries to engage as many people as possible and encourages people to voice their own opinions. Uses ppts, but those are not helpful, and you can learn most through listening in class.The topics of the course are broad, covering different areas about language such as the IPA(International Phonetic Symbols), social perspective of language and biological perspective of language etc. The topics are generally not very difficult because they are only the introductions. However, if you haven't studied IPA before, the course can be quite challenging because you are going to study and analyse the IPA of a variety of words, and this is required in the examinations.The instructor does not upload notes to the canvas, and there are also few notes distributed in the lessons. What to learn is what the instructor discusses with you in the lessons. So, make sure that you attend all lessons. Even missing one lessons can be fatal to your learning. Also, jot down the notes on what the instructors discusses every lessons. One thing to note is that the instructor always jump between topics to topics. So it can be hard to catch up if you fail to organize the information.Course provides a systematic introduction on the structure of human language in a linguistic point of view."

1026,"- Other languages covered: Cantonese (emphisizing on tones), Mandarin, Thai, Hindi, Japanese, Korean (some of which is required in the FINAL exam)Prof NG is one of the more interesting professors in HKUST. He tries to make his classes less dull, often pulling puns and jokes on himself and students (no offense) and frequently interacts with his students. He remembers every single student by name. Class ambience is usually laid back and fun."
1027,He gives out a large amount of handouts (THOUGH REALLY UNORGANIZED) which you are required to keep because they are essential for exam revisions.
1028,Videos and slideshows are frequently used in classes and you are required to remember minor details and quotes within these materials as they are assessed in exams (which is quite ridiculous if you ask me as it depends how well you generally remember things).
1029,"The biggest problem is the inconsistency of content within classes. (for summer, 3.5hr courses, breaks included) He tends to skip around covering fundamental topics and phonetics which makes it really difficult to organize your notes well (provided you will jot notes in the first place)."
1030,"Course also covers foreign languages e.g. Hindi, Thai, Japanese, Mandarin which is somewhat difficult to master within a short period of time if you're not a ""language"" person, but they will be assessed in the exam.The content discussed in the course includes general classifications of different fields in linguistics (not important), phonetics&acoustics (v. important), animal communication, some neurolinguistics, some sociolinguistics, etc. before the midterm, final largely focuses on differences between male and female and study of chinese, japanese and korean."
1031,"In general not hard, especially if you know phonetics of English already, not much to memorize (phonetics, hiragana, some classification of words, etc.), other things tested in exam is common sense"
1032,"Exam not too difficult, make sure you have revised all handouts distributed during class and memorize stuffs on the review list should be enough for an A range already.The instructor is quite enthusiastic and dynamic, however, he always jump from one topic to another topic suddenly, may be hard to follow at first."
1033,"Attendance is taken by signing a sheet passed around the LT every lesson, so if you plan to skip lessons during the term you should let your friend sign for you starting from the first lecture"
1034,"Since the content is not too sophisticated, one can actually skip class and use google+review list to learn.The content of this course is very interesting, example are such as the IPA(International Phonetic Symbols), social perspective of language and biological perspective of language etc."

1048,"have midterm and final exam, but not too longAn introductory course to linguistics. You can have a brief understanding about the topics by reading the COURSE INFO when checking course quotas. Wide topic discipline ranging from phonetics to sociolinguistics.  Expect a brief study of linguistic-related topics but not very down to depth.The professor showed his enthusiasm in teaching, but the teaching was just a mess, at least up to me. The professor talked about several incomplete topics in each lesson. Then he continued the incomplete topics in the next lesson. You will have to attend all lessons till the end of the semester in order to obtain a complete picture of the course's topics. As a systematically-trained science student, this is not my learning style but guess it maybe good to keep skipping topics for those who find no interest in some topics.Course provides a systematic introduction on the structure of human language in a linguistic point of view."

1055,"Phonetics table of English, Cantonese, Mandarin and a little bit of Japanese and Korean language will be taught. It will be better if you have learned those foreign languages already."
1056,"Overall, the main topic will be phonetic of English, and you will probably spend lots of time remembering those phonetic symbols.A pretty good professor in my opinion, really kind that he would stay after class for more than half an hour just to answer student's question. One thing that I appreciate is that he would make a review note for all the student to prepare for the mid-term and final exam, which was really helpful to me who study the exam one days prior to it."
1057,"One thing that I don't like about him is that he won't put the notes on the canvas or some internet platform, forcing students to come to his lecture. Also, his note is not really compact, with 60 notes and worksheets in total.Neuroscience"

1068,"Although the professor doesn't teach the topics sequentially, I think it is his style. So just let it go if you find confusing.The content is interesting. The materials include International phonetic alphabet, attributes of human language, difference between animals and human communication, gender difference in communicative behaviours, tones in Chinese and Putonghua and some Korean and Japanese writing. When discussing some topics, the professor will show video clips that make better and clearer understanding.Although one lesson lasts for 3.5 hours in summer semester, it will never be boring! The teaching style is interactive. He always asks questions. He gives two short breaks so you can take a rest. One bad thing is he always jumps between topic to topic. So, better organization of notes is needed.Content mostly concentrates on phonetic symbols, with interesting topics like comparison between animal and human communications, misunderstanding and miscommunication between the sexes, and gender differences in communicative behavior, with video clips shown quite often and reading materials almost every lessons. It also includes a few simple Korean and Japanese wordings towards the end of the course.The professor is very passionate and motivates students to answer questions by passing the microphone. But students need to jot down notes every lesson as there is no lecture notes given.Very interesting topic. Although it is just an introductory course of linguistic, it covers many things with examples but not just abstract things like HUMA1000The professor is very nice and teaches using video clips with good explanations.Just about 15% students got A range, 35% B range and others are C, D range, which means only half of the class got A,B range.There is no assignment at all. If you go to class to take the attendance and try to do the in-class worksheet, you'll get full mark for participation.Rather interesting content. Covers the IPA system for the whole semester, which is useful in daily life."
1069,"Begins with an introduction of human language system, comparing the similarities and difference between human and animal communication."
1070,"Also involves some parts regarding how children acquire languages as well as reasons that create communication misunderstandings.The instructor does not upload any notes on canvas. Have to attend lesson in order to get the notes and worksheet.The course is about linguistic. Half of the course content is about English phonetics. If you have learned phonetic before, this would be an advantage to you. The fundamental of Japanese and Korean are also included. The course also involves some interesting topics such how bees and monkeys communicate and how infants acquire language.Professor would upload his ppt to lmes so we have jotted down all the notes. He would sometimes play some videos to us and this would make the lecture less bored. He would remember all the students' names although the class size is quite big.The content is rather interesting, at least to me. It is nothing about grammar and those stuff we usually get to learn in our language classes. It talks about things like how children learn their mother tongue and how do different gender use language differently.The professor is funny and nice. The only bad thing is that sometimes it is rather difficult to follow in class. The professor tends to jump from one topic to another topic quite frequently, and there are no lecture notes. He does not give model answers for worksheets too, so you might have to ask him after class in case you need them."
1071,"The good thing is the professor gives handout in every single class, so as long as you have attend every lesson, you should have a free complete set of notes.You can learn something interesting and useful, so it's ok if you don't care much about grade.Not organized, often jump from here and there on contents. He also tried to cover a lots of things within limited time. But he tried to be funny as well.Harsh Grading! People got quite similar scores in exams, few difference in score really could make a big difference in grade. The questions asked something very trivial and it doesn't make sense.No homework, no assignments and projects. Just go class and do revision is enough.She is very passionate about teaching, know lots of stuff with good logic skills and mindset. She would admit her mistakes in the quizzes during classes. Students are always welcomed to ask questions after class. She would usually stay for an hour after class to answer questions. Always have interesting discussion with students. TA are also very helpful.the course is very interesting and prof shares some ideas with us about the news. TA is very responsible for explaining the material in the reading tutorial. if you are really wanna improve your thinking skill, you should try thisprof is great but sometimes she spent lots of time on asking questions and waiting for students to answer itBrief introduction on different major philosophers across our history."
1072,"No exams, but only quiz in every other tutorial section. Philosophies such as existentialism and religious thoughts will be discussed. As such, it is a fruitful course if you did not take a nap.If you are like me, who really could not withstand a monotonic teacher, then you will sleep through the whole two hours lecture. Seriously, the powerpoints are chaotic and cramped all the content together, making it really difficult to study beforehand nor to revise.the contents are basically philosophy. If you have the basic philosophical knowledge or you took philosophy before, you will definitely nail it.  Topics mainly are Aristotle, Socrates, Eichmann, common philosophy topics which I studied before. There will be group discussion every week during the tutorial, but nothing difficult at all, simply have to submit your ideas on a piece of paper. The course needs a lot of thinking, critical and clear thinking because it is philosophy after all.I would say the professor is pretty boring, the tone is really sleepy so I didn't pay much attention. Studied basically with the slides provided and lots of Wikipedia. TA is pretty funny.Not so much, attend all of the lecturers and you will have good grade. There is IPRS section, so you need to be punctual.Lecturer tried his best to let the students understand the content but I think some of the topics are not easy to understand.Good grade. I do not have a good quiz result but I still have a good grade.4 quiz, 1 essay and tutorial, participation. The 4 quiz separate the topics in to 4 parts. Nearly 3-4 lectures for 1 quiz. It is not hard to remember these 3-4 lectures. And the quiz questions is very simple.As one of the only course offered in Cantonese, the course talks about Logic, Fallacies, dilemma etc. It provides students with a way to analyze whether or not a statement is logical. The course content also allows us to think in a logical way.The teaching method is quite direct. During lectures, the lecturer will talk about all the materials covered in the syllabus. Most of the example used is quite interesting, such as quotes from celebrities our current affairs. There will be a tutorial before every quiz. it is quite useful for those who cannot understand the lectureNOTE: This review only applies to the course instructed by Professor Nelson, and is NOT applicable to HUMA 1001A."
1073,"This course focus on the text written by famous philosophical thinkers in different era and different region, including Mengzi, Arendt, Socrates e.t.c. Refer to the attached document for topics included."
1074,"Overall I would consider the content as interesting as it raise questions on the justification of some concepts which we assume to be true, for example why can we assure the knowledge we know must be true? However do note that some concepts involved might be quite abstract and difficult to understand. Also ensure your English proficiency required is quite high for academic reading of philosophical papers or you will suffer from inability to understand the reading materials.I would describe him as a mediocre professor. His speaks with monotone so people may fall asleep easily in his lecture. However content wise he did make his best attempt to translate the abstract concepts to real-life examples and explain the contents in detail. Overall I would say his strength is in content while his weakness is in his teaching style."
1075,"On the other hand, the TA (LAW, Chun Yin) out-stands from most other TA I have met. He gives great details to some difficult concepts in the canvas discussion. He is also very patient in answering students questions, so if you have any confusion about the contents, please feel free to ask him."
1076,"P. S. 1. Indeed the professor tried to make the lecture more interactive by raising some questions and expecting students volunteer to answer. However in my point of view, the nature of Hong Kong educational system makes Hong Kong people feel shy to answer questions in class, so only very few responded to his questions."

1088,"Week 12: Moore and WittgensteinThe lecture given by the professor were quite boring. Each lecture was 2-hour long, and the speaking of the professor was monotone, making me falling a sleep in almost every lesson. Also, he did not explain the abstract concepts quite clear."
1089,"However, the teaching of the TA was good. Through canvas discussion, he often explain the flaws of our arguments to us, and willing to give much comments when I was doing my final essay.Focuses on philosophical concepts such as good and evil, reality, time, existence of God, etc.The professor and the TA are really nice and responsible as they are always there to help. The professor tried to make the course content more comprehensible and interesting but since it's philosophy, the course content is still quite hard to understand right away. He also tried to invite more students to participate in in-class discussions but only few (non-local) students will join.Mostly logic and fallcies, there are also a bit rhetoring but not much. This course(Fall 16-17) is taught in Cantonese, but it will differ. In general the content is useful for research and for future life.Prof. is humorous, often uses real life experiences and current news to explain, we were encouraged to think and express ideas during class. She was also patient to answer questions even it takes a long time.About logic and different types of fallaciesProfessor Yip is very friendly and kind. She explains the concepts in details and uses many examples for our easier understanding. She welcomes students to ask questions after lessons. A lot of students stayed behind and asked her questions every lesson.Music of the world including Africa, Black America, Arab, Latin, India, China. And also some basic music knowledge. Not hard even for those who are not familiar with music. You need to know the characteristics of the music in those region and apply them to the listening track.Quite good. Although the content is somehow boring, the professor tried very hard to make it more interesting. He will ask questions and say some jokes. The best thing is that he will always extend the deadlines of the assignments and quizzes when somebody tells him that more time is needed.Great professor with a sense of humour."
1090,"I love how he talks about music and its culture, e.g. a lot of characteristics in Chinese music link to the emphasis on balance and morals in Chinese culture. He also talks about cultural homogenisation and ethnocentrism."
1091,"Always encourages in-class discussions, e.g. how we define music, what makes one culture more superior than another. Really gets you thinking."
1092,Extremely flexible with deadlines & course grades. I asked for an exntension for the deadline of the case study without difficulty.
1093,"Gives you a lot of guidance for all graded stuff, but still depends a lot on your efforts.Content included listening and analyzing the music and music cultures of different parts of the world (Africa, North America, South America, Middle East, China). Overall, I found the content to be quite interesting.The professor keeps the class interesting by mixing teaching with his own singing/instrument playing. Also encourages discussion in class. Easily approachable in person/on email.The course introduces different music cultures around the world. Even if you have zero knowledge of music theory, you will be able to understand not less than 85% of the lectures.The content of the lectures are kind of boring. He did try his best to make the lecture funnier, but not much could be changed. You might find it awkward if you go to the lectures alone because he often tells you to talk to the people next to you as a way to ""take a short break"".  If you find standing up in the middle of the lecture to act like a jerk is unbearable, then you might just as well skip the lessons or not take this course.The course teaches you about music cultures in different continents/ countries. It mainly focuses on African music, and also covers music from China, India and the Middle East. Very interesting course if you're interested in learning about different genres of music, rather than Western classical music. You don't require prior knowledge related to music, as they also cover the basic music concepts, and will teach you how to apply it through listening tracks.The professor engages students in a very interesting way, and always tries to encourage students to participate in class discussions. He would also make jokes during the class, and show a lot of music clips instead of only relying on the PowerPoint. For those who are absent, he also uploads a video of the lecture onto Canvas for those to refer to.This course is literally about the music of the world. Students learn about the music and the culture behind places like Africa, India, and China. If you have interest in learning about history, culture and any other information related to memorizing instrument names, you should take the course. Otherwise, I advise you not to take it. The professor gives us reading assignments, but I did not do them.The professor is nice. He usually sings in class. He also often plays the piano. He also brings strange instruments in class for us to observe.Music or:"
1094,Africa
1095,Black America
1096,Arab
1097,China
1098,India
1099,Latin
1100,Just memorize everything and you can do the test. The listening part is quite hard for people with no music background.He's fun but kinda scary when he's angry. He take random attendance. It's not that boring if you understand the lecture and you are interested in music of the world.Midterm:
1101,"Africa, Black America, Latin"
1102,After midterm:
1103,"India, Arab World, China"
1104,The Africa part is quite boring and the African drum music is annoying but others are nice.
1105,You can really know more about the relationship between different culture and music.Professor comes from the US so he has a nice English accent.
1106,"Although the ppt is full of words and typo, I learn many different new vocabs. I think this course is more efficient to learn English than the lang course."
1107,"Professor tried to make the class interesting and let the class stand up and sing together. He even made a traditional African instrument during the lecture.The content is pretty straightforward, mostly about details of the music cultures studied. You will have to be able to identify instruments, features of a culture and recognize the musical features of the songs studied like the texture, the rhythm and instruments. As long as you pay attention in the lectures, you will most likely understand and remember a lot of it. It is also very interesting and if you want to learn about some music history and how the music came to be, I recommend this course.The teaching is very interactive as the professor will ask loads of questions and try get answers out of you. Other than that, lots of examples are given and you will most likely retain a lot of the information because the professor makes it fun to learn and makes the lecture very interestingThis course is about music of the world, including african, Latin American, Chinese..... Generally not interesting at all. There's a lot of specific terms that you have to memorize, which may be totally irrelevant to music theory, so it may be boring to someone who want to learn music from this course.He is trying to make those boring materials interesting. He gets well-prepared before the lesson so that if you pay attention to his teaching, you may find this lesson funny.Studying music of the world, eg. africa, arab, china etc. Any music background are welcome, but it only help a little even if u have some music knowledge. Most of the content is about the instrument and music culture of different places, and also why and how they exist.He is really nice and excellent opera singer. Not like other boring lecture, he will sing and play piano during teaching. Sometimes will invite all students to try to sing or play some rhythms  together. Quite interesting.Exactly, ""Music of the world""."
1108,"The content is very broad, includes Africa, Latin, Arab, India and China etc. Since there are only a semester to teach, you can expect the music features won't be taught in a very deep level. However, there are tons of the terms such as instrument names to be remembered. If you can remember them all, you will be fine.Friendly professor. He is very nice and willing to discuss with students after class or via email. He is sometimes funny but in terms of teaching, he often just read from his notes. There are many typos in his notes and since there are many terms to be taught, his slides are lengthy. One good thing to mention is he always play piano for better delivery and to interact with students. For me, his lectures are not boring.Cover a lot of content and pretty detailed. All MC in Midterm and MC + fill in the blanks in final, around 100 questions. Discuss so much more than only music itself but also involves a lot of cultural material. Always good to have some music background but doesn't help much in this course.Great. Interesting teaching. Do a lot of listening and some singing in class.Like what the other reviews have mentioned, this course is basically all about reciting. You are required to know many languages/cultures like Indian, Middle East, Chinese, Black, South American etc. There is nothing useful about this course, and I would not remember a single thing from this course a two days after the exam, except that I would probably remember this is the worst course of my life.At least the professor is nice. But he doesn't even proofread his materials, which have a lot of low-level grammatical errors. Even a student with bad English like me could spot like 5 errors every powerpoint, which makes me think that the professor doesn't really care about language when he has to grade people based on ""grammar and spellings"". Jokes.i thought it was about some beautiful pieces like Mozart or something but what a pity, i...was...wrong. Anyway it had nothing to do with those classical pieces, but all about musical cultures around the world, which was African, North American, Indian music... I have to say that the pieces were not so pleasant, sometimes annoying, and the exams focused  mostly on its history and cultural backgrounds, anyway it's a HUMA class...the professor was quite humorous, not bad i think, although there're always some little spelling mistakes in the lecture notes hhh. his english was excellent but the vocabulary was quite professional.For people who don't like music, it would be super boring. But for me, I think it is acceptable. Basically you just have to rmb all the notes and songs are ok. Easy level.He is a good teacher in lesson he always wants to make our class interesting but it is still boring in fact. All the locals are very quiet in class.Standard grading, very bad."
1109,He said he would not give out any A+.
1110,"For me , total 88.8% > only B+"
1111,my case study : 92/100 (mean 87)
1112,concert report: 90/ 100  (mean 89)
1113,midterm : 79/ 100 (mean 71)
1114,final: 85/100 (mean 70)
1115,"Case study and concert report don't matter,"
1116,so work hard on the midterm and finals.
1117,"For participation, you can skip 3 lessons.Heavy workload. A lot of songs to recite in exams."
1118,"I spent many nights on my case study (over 3000 words tgt with evidence, log, pictures and videos) but the mark is still low.  "
1119,"There are also 2 quiz but you have one day to finish and almost everybody got full marks.it is comprehensive and suitable for anyone who wants to have shallow but wide knowledge of music. The professor also requires us to buy a book but it is not necessary for preparing for exams. You can look at the powerpoints to pass the exams. Overall its pretty good in terms of content.It is a bit boring because the lecture hall is big and easy to lose focus when people on the back are talking. Some people leave the lecture hall after they take the PRS so it is tempting to go out during middle of the class.Dont have a lot to add on the contents of the course, most of them have pretty much been mentioned by previous reviews. But remember you do not necessarily need to have a strong music background (or even a single knowkledge on music) in order to survive or get good grades in this course. You can treat this as a history course instead of a music course.The professor teaches well, even with occasional jokes. He is patient to students' questions, no matter in-class or through emails.Study about African Music, South American Music, Latin American Music, Arabic World Music, Indian Music and Chinese Music. Contains a lot of new words to memorize, and need spend much time for studying.Quite boring, though there are a lot of listening in class, and professor tried to cheer us up, but the overall atmosphere was not good.The content is pretty nice. Discusses 6 cultures."
1120,"Africa, North America, Latin America, Arab World, India and China. Introduces music music terminology and relates them to these cultures."
1121,"Exams are pretty much based on the notes.He is a really good professor. Gives nice examples and explains well. Attendance will definitely make your work easier.The title says it all. As a common core HUMA course, the name 'Music of the World' can trick you to think it is a rather easy course. NO. See the workload and teaching.The lectures are boring as hell because Isaac has a bad sense of humour although he tries his best to engage the students by asking us to stand and do stretches in the middle of the class."
1122,[Worst lecture notes]
1123,"Not concise. Very messy. Expects us to find the definitions of word lists on our own. (he gives a word list every midterm/final and says those words will be examed, however no definitions are give and we have to find them ourselves)"
1124,"He also tries to invite a guest speaker to talk about Chinese music but the speaker was also very boring and we were just given clips of the speaker playing the Sanxian.the content is all about different cultures and their music.  It is certainly fun to learn about the interments in Africa and how people in Arab make music. If you are interested in music, you will definitely find this course entertaining, BUT entertaining doesn't mean you are having a great time studying it.The teaching style is straight up reading powerpoints.  Nice guy, easily get annoyed by crowd chatting.  Nothing special, just common uni professors.Same as the course code. You will basically learn some basic concepts about every music style in the world.He teaches well. Plenty of music examples are given. For those who are not interested in music may find the lecture boring but to be frank, I think he is doing a good job that you will appreciate.Good selections from the traditional Chinese essays. Mainly from Pre-qin period.Require attention in class for he will explain all the translation on course material in class. Also need to take notes. The teacher is really nice for his humor and respect for students.Metaphors and metonymy! Analyze all kinds of metaphors. It sounds that every class it's about the same things and  theories so I felt bored. Dig into many commonly used phrases and sentences like ""falling in love"" and show that in this sentence, there's a metaphor which is LOVE IS A CONTAINER, to show that metaphors are commonly used as a conceptual tool to help people understand things.Vivid, always use actions or graphs to explain metaphors. Really excited every class and always laughing at his own jokes regardless of all the asleep students....Learn how to think logically~Teaching is hilarious. Prof. gave many examples to the concept taught in class.40% Midterm mean 26.5/40 sd 10.76"

Topics include creative thinking, logic, fallacy, paradox.Prof Yip is very humorous. She explains the concepts with great clarity and details with different real-world examples and funny stories as well as some gags. Sometimes, she will share stories and thought related and not related to the course. In short, you will never fall asleep in the class and will come to classes even if no attendance is taken.Main topics:"
1138,- methodology of art appreciation
1139,- Language of Art
1140,- Materials & Techniques
1141,"- Art Genres (History, Portraiture, Genre, Landscape & Still Life)"
1142,- From Classical Art to Renaissance
1143,- High Renaissance
1144,- Baroque Art
1145,- Neoclassicism & Romanticism
1146,- Impressionism
1147,- Modern Art
1148,- Human Body
1149,- Artist & Patronage
1150,- Social & Historical Contexts
1151,- Gender & Ethnicity
1152,- Rethinking Art
1153,The contents are pretty rich and extensive. Lecture notes in form of PPTs are provided. They include brief descriptions with the aid of images of related artworks.- Generally quite good
1154,"- Easy to follow & understandThe content covered a lot of factual and historical stuff about different art period, styles, artists etc. It was quite a lot of content being covered in a short period of time, such that if you are not good at memorizing stuff don't take this course, as the professor likes to ask some specific words that you see in the powerpoint as midterm/final exam questions. However, since the questions in the exams are very straight-forward and doesn't required critical thinking, it means that you would be able to get the answers right if you have study, read through the powerpoint thoroughly, and really memorize all the materials in the ppt then you would be good to go. All in all, I think this is a good course for you to gain adequate and introductory knowledge on western art, but only take it if you are willing to spend LOTS of time to memorize the factual materials.I would have to be honest the teaching is quite boring because the instructor just directly said the things from the powerpoint. But I understand that the instructor is also very passionate about the stuff that she is teaching. The instructor would research thoroughly on the artwork that you have chosen for your project, and would give out comments openly in lesson time after all the presentations have finished, so don't try to make up something because she always know if that is true or not haha.Rich content about Western art which mainly focuses on learning styles and characteristics across different periods. The lectures slides are almost the same as what she mentioned in class. (So if you missed the class or not paying attention in class has no serious impact on your study.) But there are quite a lot of lecture slides per lesson and therefore it could be boring sometimes.Anna is a very nice teacher but her lessons could be very boring if you are not very interested in Western art and what she says is basically what she prepared on the PPT.The contents are really helpful and fulfill my expectation for the class. Ranging from Baroque to Modern Art, basically you will have a close look into the art history.She teaches very well but many contents are listed on PPT, so what you 've heard is basically somehow the same as the words on ppt.well I am quite satisfied cuz I didn't go through reading materials at all. I only spared 3 days to memorize all the points and prepared the essay the professor needed. Answer to many questions can be find on ppt so all you need to do is to go through ppt carefully with patience.What's more can I say? If you wanna learn something, HUMA1650 is a very good class but speaking of workload, it's a totally different situation. If you wanna get good grades, there are soooooo many things you need to memorize just like typical kinda of humanities class. But if you choose to escape from the diligent hard work like me, you can be quite relaxed. So what i can say is it depends on you.Hard to comment on the professors. Prof. Sun was a bit boring in his presentations, and he had a Chinese accent, but his teaching was clear and easy to follow. Many Chinese characters examples were used in the PPT. Professor Liu had years of practical field experience, so real-life examples and photos he took are used in his teaching. Prof. Shaw had very nice English. Three professors delivered the lessons quite differently.You can know about what is your future career, who is going to help, what is going on with the exchange and what the curriculum of QSA is really about, etc."
1155,"Quite fun, quite easy, useful information. What you would expect in a 1-credit course.Teaching is good, professor is knowledgeable and caring.Cameron is not the kind of person who can deliver good presentations. As the classes in this semester are both introductory so he acted more like a guide rather than an instructor. But he will give you all the knowledge and experiences he has."
1156,BTW a friend of mine who took SOSC5110 this semester said he was really strict in the research tutorial.
1157,"Bad news.This course basically is try to lead year 1 QSA student to be familiar with and prepare for their study in HKUST.Every week with have some new topics to talk about, for example: exchange, school policy, internship, QSA major requirement discussion etc... I think the content with be different in every year. But overall is quite good, and i think it worth your time to attend this course.The course is basically divided into 2 parts (arguably 2 and a half), separated by the midterm exam. A brief history of East Asia after WWII is outlined before the midterm, topics discussed include cold war (which will be a recurring theme in the course afterwards), korean war, vietnamese war, bandung conference, sino-india conflicts, sino-soviet split, sino-US relationships, reformation by gorbachev, etc. Midterm exam consists of MCQs only yet they are not easy, understandings on small details (eg. chronological orders of events in a certain war), readings (including comparisons between the arguments proposed by different scholars, meaning that thorough understanding and memory on readings are required, including the names of the author, FML), and something only mentioned in class but not on the slides are required. After the midterm exam, the focus of the course turns into explanation of historical events, different IR theories are introduced, explaining why a certain state would make certain decisions. The 0.5 part is the simulation game which the professor has put a lot of focus in, students are divided into groups, representing different countries and organisations and thrown in to a situation that a conflict may happen"
1158,"Final exam requires you to answer 4 out of 6 essay type questions in 2 hours, yet ~20 possible questions are given in advance so you can prepare a brief outline beforehand.The professor is enthusiastic and teaches with much passion, slides are used as outline only and details are either skipped or barely mentioned, he likes to ask questions and be asked during lectures, and would lightly mock you if you refuse to answer his questions. Logical flow is a bit lacking and the amount of information conveyed is quite large, but following shd not be too hard if do pay attention during lectures.Interesting contents, history buffs and social science lovers will love this course more than any other courses in HKUST."
1159,"Despite its name, it does not only focus on 'the International Relations of East Asia' but also tend to focus on the United States and South East Asian countries such as the three indochina nations and Taiwan (it might count as East Asia but...)  Well, does not hurt you, it is true that knowledge on these nations is crucial to understand the East Asian history and politics.The lectures are very interesting; partly because I am originally fond of social science, and mostly because professor knows how to tell interesting social science jokes which I enjoyed a LOT."
1160,"Sometimes, other lecturers from different institutions visit UST to teach us about special topics; they were quite enlightening."
1161,"WELL, one thing that I should comment about this course is that I feel this course highly disorganized. the PPTs are often uploaded late, and we, overall, failed to follow what the syllabus indicated. Therefore, attend your lectures so that you know what the class is actually learning about (looking at the syllabus and self-studying is not likely to be a good idea)In the first part, it pays more attention to relations between USA, Russia and China and examines reasons behind historical events.  "
1162,"In the second part, it focuses on theories and strategies in political science.It depends. If you are interested in political science, you would say his teaching excellent, especially he has a sharp tongue. He basically follows the lecture notes and explain terms, theories and reasons of it.Before midterm it was all about basic historic facts in http://E.Asia from the end of WWII. After the midterm, we went in depth to think more about the reasons behind the facts. We learnt to analyze from different perspectives.DZ is a good professor. Not only did he conveyed himself clearly in lectures, but also he showed much respect to every student in his class. For example, I guess he can tell 80% of the students' names. He is always patient to answer questions and encourages us to develop interest in what we learn through group work and a simulation game.The content is on the international relations of southeast asia. the course content is historical background and also update with current issues.He encourages active inclass participation. Also, he has a integrative mock-un kind of project at the end of the semseter. It is fun to do, but a bit demanding too. He has high expectations from us in both quality and quantity. The class in quite small but he still manages to ask all the students around the class to pick to answer questions. The lecture itself is on ppt and in class discussion.most are similar to the secondary school syllabus"
1163,but still easy for those haven't study before
1164,"Course Description: This course introduces the fundamental theories of microeconomics and macroeconomics.

1187,"XI. Basic concepts of open-economy macroeconomics (if time permits)normalThe first three chapters are about microeconomics, and the other eleven chapters are about macroeconomics. The content is abundant and useful, especially for students from science and engineering. In the last two lectures of this course, students have to watch a movie called 'inside job' and this will be examined in the final.A German professor whose English is easy to understand.- basic macroeconomics and most content should be  under the DSE syllabus"
1188,-no attendance  no prs
1189,"-A documentary (""Inside Job"")  will be included in the course, which is VERY IMPORTANT i think as final essay question will mainly base on it."
1190,generally the content in easy-There will be two lectures per week : one of the lecture will  be used for assignment solution.
1191,-dull teaching
1192,"-except the lectures with showing the film i think theres no need to attain the lectureAs a science student, I think the contents are quite interesting. However, when it comes to the concepts related to taxation and margins, it started to become a bit confusing and took me much time to figure them out when studying for finals.By virtue of the fact that I can't stand with her accents and she talked too slow with stutters, I didn't pay attention to her lecturing. This low rating is given for her accents actually.Most of the content is about Economics covered in DSE."
1193,"Only some concepts introduced need you to understand, but it is quite easy."
1194,The concepts are similar and they are all written in the lecture notes.

1205,"XI. Basic concepts of open-economy macroeconomics (if time permits)Although the instructor got her accent, the teaching was acceptable. She was willing to answer questions."
1206,"Another thing is that she uploaded lectures only on the weekend night, which was the night before the lecture held. It was difficult for you to do preparation before the lecture.The content in this semester differs a lot from the previous semesters, perhaps it is due to the change of instructor. The content is simple, similar to HKDSE economics level, but not all topics in HKDSE are included in this course."

Sometimes, it was difficult to hear what she said. Moreover, she often uploaded the notes on canvas after a week, so it was quite difficult for an immediate revision.dse econ with one or two new topicsvery bad"
1215,prof.'s spoken english is not that good
1216,and she is just speak out the powerpointgood grade

1222,1 final
1223,"problem set is easy and the most people got full mark in all the problem setBasically a half of HKDSE economics. Easy for those who have econmoics base, and still easy for those who haven't.Strong and unclear mainland accent, hard to understand."
1224,Go to class only because of unannounced quizzes.I think the grade is quite good.
1225,"Hand in 2 problem sets and below 1sd in midterm, got B-."
1226,"Didn't take back my quizzes and the marks for final is not released.3 problem sets, total 15%"
1227,"2 unannounced quizzes, count the higher one 10%"
1228,Midterm 30% and final 45%.
1229,Spent about 3-4 hours to read the lecture notes once for midterm and final.The content is generally easy to follow and not hard to understand.
1230,The concepts involved in the course are not difficult at all. However the things you need to memorize is quite a lot.
1231,The course gives you a brief introduction to a lot of things in economics.
1232,"As a student has no economics background at all, I can still manage this course throughout this semester.Professor Li talks kinda slow and makes students to fall asleep easily. She does try to ask more questions and rise the attention, but it doesn't work AT ALL."
1233,"Besides, all the mid-term, quizzes, problem sets and final are marked and returned to us in a long time. It takes them a relatively long time to review the above materials. I can only get back my quiz and mid-term in the final study break- Introduction to macroeconomics (the first two (or three) chapters are the same as microeconomics). Good for those who would like to learn Econ but did not take any Econ courses before."
1234,- incredibly easy for those who took Econ in high school
1235,- finish whole textbook (14 units) in one semester. The teaching speed is incredibly fast for those who have never taken Econ.
1236,"- Please don't forget to watch the documentary. It will be covered in the exam. (20 marks, essay format)"
1237,- you don't have to buy the textbook even if you didn't learn econ before- A lot of learning freedom!
1238,you are welcome to skip all the lessons if you can self-study. All the learning materials are available before the first lesson. He emphasizes that he will not make the exam unfair to those did not take lessons.
1239,- teaching speed is too fast for those who did not take ECON in high school
1240,- he explains the concept quite clearly
1241,- his tone makes my friends and me sleepy thoughSuper basic in the first few chapters but a bit more diffcult in the later chapters
1242,"Concepts are SUPER IMPORTANT in this course especially those about interest rates, inflation etcI have attended less than 5 lectures and honestly lectures are boring af and NOT necessnary (no attendance taken)Very similar to high school economic syllabus"
1243,Problem is that you need to learn a 3-year-curriculum in 1 semester
1244,Piece of cake if you have studied in high schoolnice and clear
1245,Ppt includes typical examples which are useful for revision
1246,Skipping lesson will be okay.
1247,"Not too much difficult concept need to be explainedThe content is fairly easy. The course covers stuff that are pretty much present in your high school economics, such as the ""7 principles"" of economics, the economy in the long run, the economy in the short run and the international economy. The concepts are not hard to understand at all, if you do read the slides and the textbook.The slides are well made, so it is easy to understand the concepts just by reading the slides. The textbooks do have better explanation, but the textbook also sometimes contain extra lines of information that is completely redundant in the face of an examination or real-life application. Use the slides to teach yourself, while clearing any doubts with the textbook.The course covered basic topics in Economics. The content is similar to DSE Economics, I haven't taken Economics in DSE though, I heard it from my friend. The contents include comparative advantage, supply and demand, labour market, monetary policy and fiscal policy etc. Personally I found it not very difficult to grasp if you are hard-working enough to read all of the powerpoints and skim the textbook. However you need to pay attention to calculations since the final asked a lot about that. at almost the end of the lecture a movie about the financial crisis of USA will be played. Pay attention to the movie since the final asked quite a lot about that. Better watch it again in idol time.Holzs' voice is a bit dull but his English is fluent and easy to understand. He was quite eager to answer students' questions and will use role playing games to let us understand the concepts better. Also, some concepts from the powerpoints and textbooks were not really correct and he explained the mistakes clearly. However since he didn't really speak up and his voice is boring, not many students listen to his lectures. He even said we didn't actually need to attend the lectures at the beginning of the course since he thought the materials on canvas are adequate.It teaches basic macroeconomics and most content are covered in DSE syllabus. So anyone who have studied econ in secondary schools can easily catch up with it."
1248,"At the first lecture, the professor said ""If you don't want to come to lecture, then don't come"" so basically you can self-study the entire course."
1249,"A documentary (""Inside Job"") is watched during the last few lessons, it basically covers what exactly happened during the Subprime mortgage crisis in 2007-08. It is strongly recommend to watch it in lecture and the content will be tested in final exam."
1250,"Important : Make sure you obtain all answers for the movie's assignment, there were 20 marks in the final asking about the film!"
1251,P.S. This film won the 83th Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Simply a masterpiece.The professor is willing to answer student's questions on or after the class.
1252,There are two lectures per week and one of the lecture will  be used for assignment solution. The professor will explain the questions in details.
1253,"The voice of professor seems a bit dull.The course covers some very basic economics concepts. More specifically, this course is an introduction to macroeconomics."
1254,"The course also covers a documentary, 'Inside Job', which is about the 2008 Financial Crisis."
1255,"Overall, if you have studied economics in high school, you will have a huge advantage, but it is still possible to do well if you have no prior knowledge in economics--quite a lot of the content can be deduced from common sense, and others require memorization.The professors mainly follows the powerpoint only, so nothing remarkable really happens. Thanks in part to the 'active' participation of the students in class, the lectures tends to be rather boring. In other words, since attendance is not compulsory, it is definitely viable to self-study the contents of this course. (Given that I missed half of the lectures myself, I can verify this)."
1256,"If I am to attend only 1 lecture for this course, it would probably be the final on 'Inside Job', where he gives a bit more detailed explanation on some of the topics such as leverage, which turns out was covered rather extensively in the final exam. Other than that, since you can watch the documentary on your own, you really do not have to attend the lessons.Interesting content with a considerable portion of the course related to daily life. Quite comprehensive coverage per section. Theory-based with quite some real-life examples to support. Sometimes there are interesting videos which show some experiments in relations to the class materials."
1257,"However the exams cover some content out of slides but in the textbook so reading materials do matterWith good English and effort in organising the teaching materials, it is very easy to follow through and revisit the materials. Very kind in answering questions from students. Will usually stay behind lessons to answer students' questions.Interesting. The topics are related to daily life, such as love relationship, career, personality. I am not that keen on psycho before attending her lectures, but the prof. manage to arouse my interest to the topicSuper clear and interesting! Never sleep in lesson! She will give out adequate examples and provide interesting video clip during classThe course content was quite similar with sosc1960, so you would probably take an advantage by studying two courses."

1321,but in-class notes were included in exams.
1322,"classes were somehow interesting, there were some videos showing in the class.Easy to understand and very basic concepts so content  is quite simple.Interesting examples provided in class. The lecture slides have key words missing at times as the prof wants students to come to class and pay attention.If you put adequate effort, it is not difficult at all to get a good grade.There was a group project that took some time and you have to go for 3 surveys to get the research participation scores. 2 basic quizzes (instead of a midterm or final exam)  that are non-cumulative.I read through the text book only because it was extremely interesting for me. However, lecture content sometimes does not correspond to text book, and this is the reason why you need to attend the lessonNeither cell-phone nor laptop during the class, which I found to be a good way of teaching. Moreover Michelle is a funny person.Mid term: Introduction of Psychology, Emotion, Everyday Coping and Personality"
1323,"Final: Self, Romantic Love, Gender Behavior and Psychology of Work"
1324,It is all about psychology with psychological work back up. Tons of psychological studies have been quoted and illustrated to give evidence to human behaviors.
1325,"The content is interesting and will force you to ponder over it.Michelle is an awesome Prof that concepts are easy to remember through her explanation. She often shares her experience and link it to the course concepts. Though she sometimes make fun of students causing us to feel embarrassed, the class is full of laugh.  It is never boring to attend her class. Make sure you are on time and don't use your phone during the class so as to avoid being the center of attention as Michelle will point at you :PFirst three weeks are about history of modern China from 1911 revolution to contemporary. Then the topics will mainly turn to the economics, politics and society of contemporary China. Thought most content are not deep enough, from my point of view, this is course is quite a good choice for those without common sense about China. This course will give you a basic outline of contemporary China. If you want deeper insight, you'd better take more courses or do more reading.Professor is a Ph.D from Princeton with deep insight into China. Besides English, he is also fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese. A nice teacher, though I'm easy to fell asleep in class.(His voice makes me sleepy!)"
1326,"Two TAs. One is obviously from mainland because her English is so terrible. Another is native speaker but received her PhD at Tsinghua University, so she can also speak Mandarin.This course basically covers some background information and political, economic, social and cultural developments in China. Videos are played and discussions are held afterwards during tutorials.Prof. Lin does wrap-ups and repeats the important points at the end of each topic which helps us a lot in summarising the content for revision. However, frankly speaking, he speaks with no punctuation at all so it might be difficult to stay focused during lectures.The course is about political, social and economic development of China. It involves little Chinese history in the first half of semester.Prof's teaching is veryyyyyyy boring, hard to stay awake in the lesson. Lots of students are either sleeping or working on their own. But don't worry, even though you sleep in the lesson, revising the powerpoint just before the mid-term and exam is ok. Mid-term and exam are mainly from powerpoint. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the terms and concepts before going to mid-term and exam.Pre-reg course for all Global China Studies students"
1327,"Area:the economics, culture, some politics of  China since 1949 until nowhis voice is monotone"
1328,feel bored and sleepy while listening what he sayingi think its still a good grade course even i cannot get any good grade from it :(
1329,becuz the curve is quite high ( cuz they are easy)
1330,midterm : 25 mc and the mean is 18/25very light workload
1331,midterm and final are just open book mc
1332,"although the questions are little bit challenging, its ok as long as you hv read and understand wt's going on"
1333,"hv tutorial(take attendance too), need to answer some questions so as to get the participation marks.Compulsory course for GCS year 1 students. It's all about the evolution of China from 1911 to nowadays economically, socially etc. Not necessarily a course for you if you've already had an adequate understanding of Chinese history cuz you already know everything, but if you want to get a good grade then go ahead.Prof. Lin is a passionate teacher, he'll answer any question you have for him in great detail. His teaching is quite boring tho cuz he has that monotone voice, so its easy for you to fall asleep BUT PLEASE DONT cuz a lot of questions in exams are based on his verbal presentation instead of the powerpoint."
1334,"You can skip class if you have enough knowledge/common sense to answer the questions in exams, just ask someone to sign for you.the course only covers the very basic knowledge of contemporary China. Not difficult to understand. Part of the content is quite similar to HKDSE¡¯s Liberal Studies.not bad, but it is a bit boring. You can choose to skip class if you¡¯re already very familiar with the history and development of China. But I recommend those who didn¡¯t study Chinese history in high school to pay attention in class in order to get a good grade.The content of this course is about the situation of contemporary China£¨1949-now), which covers different aspects such as politics, economy, social and culture. In this semester there is a total of 7 parts of notes. Mid term will examine the first 3 notes and the rest in final.The professor is a good guy but his lectures were extremely boring. He basically speaks in just a single tone and made students extremely hard to maintain focus. The content of his lecture is basically same as the notes, However, additional information which will be useful for the exam will be mentioned during lectures, Students who aim A range should pay attention, or else, you can just skip the lecture and go to tutorials.The content is quite overwhelming. If I remember correctly there were 6-7 topics. Most of the are quite large.I enjoyed the teaching but you had you go to every class in order to jot down everything the professor says because he will not be testing on what the power points already give you. He will be mentioning key points during the lectures that you have to write down and remember for the midterm and finalIntroductory course about Chinese development in the pre and especially post-Mao era. The professor includes both qualitative and quantitative economic and sociological data on slides, and assesses the historical progression of China through social, political, economic lenses.Teaching is lecture-based, with one lecture per week, and tutorials every two weeks. Tutorials revolve around discussion of a video clip that is around 60 minutes. The instructor has good english and likes to deviate from what is seen on the slides, he does not read off the slides. Attendance is important in order to gain additional information and analysis of slide content before the exam.It talks about Contemporary China, which was the period after 1949. The things are very easy to understand and follow if you have very basic knowledge about China or have studied liberal studies about modern china in high school. It does not really matter whether you have studied history in high school or not because the professor explains things in a very detailed way that even me who have no history background can understand all the stuff.I would say the professor is one of my favorite professors in UST. You can feel his passion in teaching that he is well-prepared. He can speak very fluently and with good pronunciation despite the fact that he comes from the mainland.  The only thing that may not be very good to most students is that his tone is so flat that many may easily fall asleep.just some chinese history/facts after 1949. Quite a lot of the content is just common sense if you are local/mainland studentsthe prof is explaining the content quite well in English. But u may find it a bit boring since u know some of the contents already.mean is very high for mid term and final exam,>85%. many people get A range."
1335,"Grade depends on attendance, mid term and final exam.very good. no homework or projects. Just attend the lectures tutorials mid term and final exam.The content is mainly about the history,culture after the PRC rules China. I think it is easy to handle.Prof. is very nice as he was always willing to answer students' questions. However, I think it is a bit boring.I think it is quite good, I didn't listen much to his lectures, but only rely on the notes and I finally got a B.Light workload, only mid term and final, and both open book. However, you should attend every lectures as attendance is counted.The content of the class is very interesting. I learned a lot through this course and the professor seems very passionate about the materials covered in the class.The pace can be too quick at first but once the student adapts and discovers an efficient way to take notes during the lectures, exams become easier as the tests are open-note.No CommentIt's boring. The professor basically reads out what was on the ppt.Grading is really good. I got an A- even though I skipped almost 5 classes. For mid-term, out of 25 questions I got 23. And for final exam, I got 35 out of 40. The catch is I didn't even go to class or study because it's an open book exam.Attendance is 10%. But other than that there are only two open book exams. You will also gain extra points if you ask or answer questions during lectures or tutorials. You also do not have to do any readings.major developments and changes in China since 1949 from a multidisciplinary social science perspective. Topics include the background and structure of the State and the Government, Socialist Economy and Economic Reform, Rural-Urban Divide, The Work Unit System etc. For those who takes DSE has learnt some concepts in the subject of liberal studies.Each lecture lasts for 1 hour and 50 minutes, one lecture each week. The teaching is quite boring, just go through the PPT with 90% words and 10% graphic stuffs. You don't need to participate actively in class as no participating cards are given but there are some pop-quiz in random lectures which take attendance, and your correct answers are counted in this area. Tutorial classes are even more interesting than the lectures where videos or documentary films of modern of China is played and it lasts for almost a hour. After that, there are some discussions on that videos, just easy stuffs, and attendance is counted in tutorials.As a pre-reg course for GCS Year 1 student"
1336,"Covered different topics of China, such as political, economic, social, cultural changes and continuities"
1337,each topic cover from 1949 to present
1338,quite like a beginning course to learn more about China as it cover quite many factsProfessor Lin can provide a comprehensive teaching in the class as he provides many data to support his view
1339,He and the TA are willing to answer our inquiries  
1340,You need to pay attention in class as some of the contents tested were    not in the ppt but mentioned orally
1341,"If you want a good grade, jot down what he said!The course is about the social change in China starting the 1950 to modern stage. I think the content is quite similar to the Modern China, a module in Liberal Studies in HKDSE. If you are interested in China social policies and development, this course is not difficult to you.The course consists of lectures and tutorials. I think the teaching style is unique from other courses. You can feel free to ask question and interact with lecturers. It is helpful when you take all the courses though attendance and participation are included in grading.Contents are quite interesting to learn about. Till the end of the course, its about cultural change and the contents of it are quite logical, not much memorizing, all quite common knowledge. The hardest part would be the political part but still manageable.Okay.Very easy to understand."
1342,Just be careful when choosing the lecture.
1343,Lin Yi-Min's teaching is better (clearly explain the concepts) and less workload
1344,AND don't skip the class
1345,(I swapped to Lin Yi-Min 's lecture from Wu Xiaogang's. )All the concepts are clearly explained.
1346,"Professor is nice.It is about some Chinese history and development. The content ranges from economic to social and political changes of China.Prof teaches well as he will explain everything in details but make sure you go to every lessons and jot the details down as they will appear in the exams.There are many mainland students and students from SHSS taking this course so the mean is quite high. The mean for mid term is 20/25.There are only 1 mid term with 25 mc and 1 final with 40 mc. Both are open book. All lessons and tutorials take attendance and you have to participate in tutorials for 3 times in order to get 5% mark.Covers different aspects of China after 1949, such as politics, economics, culture and social change, etc. The content is quite easy since it is just a introductory course. However, since it is a 2-hr/lecture course, for those who are not interested in Chinese History, you may find it hard to focus in the lecture...(but you need to do so since the prof. will exam some small details he had mentioned in the lecture but not in the notes orz)The professor can answer the questions raised by the students clearly and provide more details about it. However, his intonation may make you fall asleep in the 2-hr class..."
1347,"For the tutorial, the IA (instructor assistant) did not perform well and the learning environment was so bad. Anyway you just need to answer 3 questions and attend all the tutorials to score full marks for the attendance.For students who are interested in China, the development and difficulties encountered, students can try to attend this course."
1348,"This course covers the basic history of China, the development of the Chinese Communist Party, and the current challenges faced in the current Chinese Government.The lecturer is okay. However, the lecture quite boring, and the lecture lasts about 1 hours and 50 minutes. Better come to the lecture with a cup of coffee.focus on the development of China after the establishment of PRC. Most likely, in economic aspect (reforms and opening up policy), political aspect (Party and the state hierarchy)..."
1349,"**Do not try to compare with another class (L1) which is taught  by Prof. Lin. Two courses have different contents.read aloud the PPT every time. TAs will provide with  guidance for our term paper if you need their help. No active guidance given. No sample was given. The lesson time is much longer than other courses. The tutorial sessions and lectures take up 1 hour and 50 minutes each. It's really long.Quite interesting if you're interested in Chinese history. The powerpoint slides have really limited content, so it's pretty much a must to pay attention in class and jot notes. Of course, this is a challenge to most people..If you pay attention, you could tell that the professor does have strong knowledge in this area. But he speaks in a rather flat tone.The content per se is interesting. Class material put a lot of emphasis on uncovering the true problems currently face by the Chinese Gov. and its people.Teaching is worse. Professor is capricious, he changes"
1350,"a lot of the grouping, grading benchmark, etc. after add/drop period. Also, the teaching relies heavily on videos (10 videos / week).**no official textbook**, however, as an idiot of Economics and Chinese political structure, go to read Barry Naughton's book: The Chinese Economy: Transitions of Growth."
1351,"This is a mix course of Economics and Politics. Economic Theory is important, esp. Macro-, Updated knowledge in Chinese political structure is also important."
1352,Some readings that I recommend you to read even you are not in the class.
1353,1) Victor Shih: Financial instability in China
1354,"2) Elvin Mark: Quantitative Growth, Qualitative Standstill"
1355,3) Qian Yingyi: How reform worked in China
1356,4) Mao Zedong: On 10 major relationships (an interesting article in testing your logic)
1357,5) Vivienne Shue: From Heshang to Falungong
1358,"After you read this, you will gain better knowledge in knowing what's going on in China. Nowadays, when you are seeking for jobs, these knowledge are helpful.Super easy-going professor."
1359,He won't take attendance.
1360,He won't urge you to do homework.
1361,"He won't force people doing something they don't like.It is not based on textbook. Pr selects the reading materials that fits more to the current state of china's poli econ market. You would have to have econ and social science background for this course.You have to read the readings before the lecture!!! the selected readings are bit tough, but the professor explains at the lecture very well. There is no ppt slide, it requires both discussion and notetaking.This course covers topics about Hong Kong. The professor tries to cover all the topics but obviously this makes him unable to deliver any insightful content.The worst professor I have met in social science. He is one freaking stubborn and arrogant person who deeply believes that he is smart and humorous and his class is entertaining and inspiring, which cannot be further from the truth. He wants his students to think the same way as he looks at the issues. The only answer he accepts is the one he provides during the class. If you like spoon-feeding and being brain-washed, please go ahead.PART ONE:  SOCIAL CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT"
1362,PART TWO. SOCIAL AND POLITICAL INEQUALITIES
1363,"PART THREE. IDENTITY, CONSUMERISM AND FAMILYThe content is about HK society so many content is around HK news and hot topics.  Local people definitely have some advantage.  However,  there are so many topics and each topic has many many ppt slides.He is a kind person.  "
1364,He wants an interactive class so class participation is so important.  Answering questions frequently will leave him a good impression.
1365,"The notes don't have everything he said in class so you better attend the class.  He played video in class quite often.Mainly about Hong Kong social development, like income disparity, racial discrimination. Quite easy for local students. There's also a voluntary project in different topics to help the racial minority in Hong Kong.Interesting, there are many interaction between professor and us. But no cellphone and tablets can be used during the lesson as he encouraged us to write the notes.You learn about Hong Kong and how it was able to industrialize so quickly, and many of the issues facing it today. Interesting if you have an interest in how Hong Kong got to be the way it is today.Professor is British and engaging. Tries to make things interesting by engaging students.Covers a variety of topics regarding HK. ""A sociologically informed examination of Hong Kong society. Topics include social change, political, economic and gender inequalities, the rise of the democracy movement, discrimination, consumer culture, identity, intimacy, and family life.""Hard to concentrate in lesson.An upgrade version of DSE L.S. that focuses less on the cause and effect but more on motives and actions of individuals being just a tiny part of how society works. We talked about politics, cultures, gender. Best if you're already good with L.S. or like to watch news stories. Interesting course for exchange students if you want to learn more about HK. Shame he can't finish all topics.Prof. Groves' sound is nice to listen to, won't send you to sleep. Tell interesting stories and taught me a new perspective, good job in introducing sociology.An introductory course covering almost everything about Hong Kong. Should not be hard if you are a local and pay attention to what happens around youAll electronic devices are not allowed. Lectures could be pretty boring as professional can dwell on one topic for very long timePretty easy to get a good grade. As long as you read all the readings and the powerpoints. Lectures are not that important. Extra credits are given for participating in voluntary works.Mid-term and final only. Workload is almost non-existent if you choose not to participate in voluntary works.The content is very interesting that you could learn many things that you will never notice. For example, Prof. Groves taught us something about the Hong Kong sex industry and gave us the chance to talk to a related non-profit organization. It is a great opportunity to learn out of the campus.Prof. Groves is a very humorous professor that he taught us in a funny way. Although his voice is a little bit soft that sometimes make me feel sleepy, his lessons are not boring as he included different teaching materials/methods such as videos, discussions or others.PART ONE: SOCIAL CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT"
1366,PART TWO: SOCIAL AND POLITICAL INEQUALITIES
1367,"PART THREE: IDENTITY, CONSUMERISM AND FAMILYThe professor is engaging, and allows active student participation. The professor does not allow electronics in class and will not post lecture notes before class, so you will have to jot down a lot of notes in class.There are quite a lot of reference have been assigned to read, but it is not necessary to  read them all. Most of the point are included in the PPT. Most of the content is about the late- imperial empire which was taught in secondary school.  It will not take attendance and you can read all the reading material for midterm exam without taking any lessons.Most of the lecture are reading the main point in the reference. One of the lesson are midterm and one is for students sharing their work. If you are not concentrate in the lesson, the professor may ask you to leave.basic historical background and critically examine the causal structure of ¡°growth without development¡±"
1368,"specific topics in agrarian economy, city and market, merchant ethics, state-market interactions in famine relief, industrial development and capital formation, and monetary system and public finance"
1369,some of the institutional defects of the Chinese economy and how they affected the transformation of China into a modern economy in the late nineteenth century.
1370,There is also some portion about Sino-Korea and Sino-Japan relationship in the very end of the course.Excellent teaching. I love how he speak English <3
1371,"His lectures are inspiring, he often ask questions that I never thought of and I can't help thinking after lecture, and those questions only lead you to more questions. so I encourage you to actively engage in discussion during lectures, it helps a lot!"
1372,"But his slides are poorly made, only consist of some basic information about the questions he wants to discuss, sometimes only a question for a slide, so you better go to lectures as there is also no lecture videos.the course mainly deals with the motivation and process of modernisation in late imperial China. every week some theory (mainly from sinology) and facts will be introduced and there will be some logical reasoning and discussion in class. there is also assigned reading concerning the topic of the week. but the lecture is actually professor's own understanding about the topic and is not exactly the same with the reading.the professor speaks very good English and encourages discussion in class. there was active interaction in the class among students from very diverse backgrounds, which was quite interesting to me.The course goes over China's development and its relationship with Africa, Tibet and Taiwan. The content is quite interesting as it offers a different aspect on many of the activities which China is often known and frowned upon for.Teaches through lectures only but they are easy to comprehend as he speaks slowly and clearly, always has the presentations uploaded before class. He also always uploads lecture videos so attendance isn't vital.The professor focused only on two specific topics of China diplomatic relations (China-US and China-Africa). There are 4 and 9 ppts for the topics respectively. For China-US relation, he mentioned about economic and political (human rights, Taiwan and Tibet) issues between the two countries. For China-Africa relations, he started the topic by explaining some of the theories of development. After that, he looked at several aspects   including mining, agriculture, neo-colonialism, etc, followed by some additional discourse such as localization and rationalization of labour.The prof has plentiful knowledge and experiences in this domain and he is willing and able to answer questions from the students. The issues and concepts selected are quite suitable for students to have better understanding on those topics."
1373,"However, the bilingual ppts are a bit lengthy and not well-designed. The Chinese part can be useful but sometimes misleading. Students may feel difficult to go through all the content."
1374,"The tutorials are optional, mainly recapping the lecture materials.The course goes over the economic development and societal changes of China over the last 1000 years or so, with more focus on recent centuries. The changes are analysed under different social theories and analysis methods."
1375,"For someone with a lot of experience in social science, the stuff learned here might be pretty simple and boring, but for the average engineering student (me) this course was pretty interesting."
1376,"The worst part is that the credits for this course is relatively useless for an engineering studentThe prof speaks good English, goes more in depth than the lecture notes, and invites a bunch of class discussion. Pity no one says anything."
1377,"His delivery isn't that interesting, but that's alright.Powerpoint is well explained. Content is okay, there are PRS every lesson to test your knowledge.The teacher is very nice, explain everything clearly. He is very funny and kind, will answer question asap. He will play music in the start of the lesson and in the break! Very cool teacher with a loud voice.Interesting content"
1378,"It's all about the relationship among Science, Tech and Business.a nice tutor"
1379,"willing to listen to students' opinions and try to accommodate them to help them enjoy the lesson meanwhile understand the material thoroughly.too much content. as a year-1 student, i don't think it's easy to carry. Especially for the non-English background students. the English requirement is quite high. though, it will be interesting if people are interested in the relationship between the society and business.great teaching. the professor was trying to make everyone understand the contents. he is democratic to let us make decisions.It's all about the relationship among Science, Tech and Business. If you have studied courses from both science and business, should be easy.He is funny. There were videos in classes but not that interesting. Attendance was taken randomly by PRS. He is willing to give tips and assistance to your learning.Quite Good I think."
1380,Only study the ppt can get fair grade ( B range)
1381,"If you aim at A range, you have to get nearly full mark in exam and attendance.Nothing to do."
1382,"Only mid term and finals, only MCQsAs the course title suggests, it discusses the role of science and technology in the business world as well as society in general. It puts a lot of focus on innovations: how it starts, develops and impacts. Content is rather theoretical before the mid-term but gets much more practical as the course progresses.Brilliant teaching. Listens to students' opinions and tries to accommodate them (even though the class is obnoxiously large!) E.g. lengthened time allowed for the finals after some students commented on the tight timing in the mid-term.The content is quote interesting, as it focuses on the relationship between science, technology and business. It's more focused on what innovation is, and the role it plays in business contexts.The professor is very passionate about this topic. As I understand, he happens to be one of the more prominent contributors of the field of science. technology and business. He can get a bit too loud (just go to the lectures and you'll know) while talking, but is quite sporty about it, and won't get angry if you tell him to speak softer. The TA is nonexistent, but there is no need for one, it seems.Rich content (definitions, concepts,theories) , includes a lot about innovation and technology"
1383,Need to take time to memoriseNot really boring
1384,Will play music before lesson starts
1385,"But almost no interaction during class as the class is too largeThe mean is quite high, you can only get a B- if you reach mean in final and midterms."
1386,Lower than mean: C+Assignment:
1387,"Only iprs during classes, so need to attend all classes."
1388,1 Midterm and 1 final:
1389,Question type: MC (need to memorise the contents in ppt)
1390,"Syllabus will be accumulated in finalThey are many theories, proofs and structures to remember. It is explained in simple and direct english in detail. However, there is a huge amount of content to remember. So if you're not good in memorising I do not recommend this course for you.Sharif is very passionate and enthusiastic. Fluent in both Cantonese and English. He is very helpful and he spends his time to explain his lectures accurately.not interesting or related in our daily life in any sense. most students just sleep at class and wait for the iprs. basically it is not relevant to any of your further studies except if you study in gcs.tutor is passionate yet since the content is fairly boring most people just sleep at class... tutor is nice and friendly and will answer your questions in email or in person.The content is pretty general and not terribly interesting. The professor tried to give case studies to make the information more applicable, but those who aren't going into Social Sciences may find it a bit boring.The professor explains concepts very clearly and very well, which makes up for the boring content. He is not than happy to listen to student questions and feedback. Plus, he plays music before class and during breaks. Overall he's just a cool guyThe course mainly examines the inter-relations of science, technology and business, ie, how they affect one another. Some of the topics are innovation and invention, pacific rim (something related to industrial revolution), etc.The prof is quite good. He gives a lot of examples so as to illustrate different concepts or ideas. There's always break during the lectures. There's iprs.The course divides into three main parts: Science, Technology and Business. It talks about innovations and different business models. A lot of readings are provided in order to help you to understand the in-depth course content.Prof. Sharif is fun. He explains difficult concept in a great way repeatedly so you won't miss a thing he explains.The content is good. The Science part is more about the nature of experiments, such as the idea of Karl Popper. The Technology part is more about examples.The Business part is relatively general, as I can still understand without any business background."
1391,"After midterm, the concept of innovation and industrial revolution would be discussed more profoundly.The professor is quite interactive. He would answer students' question in and out of the class, although he ran away quickly sometimes.Mostly about how science, technology and business affect each other. Not exactly interesting but not too boring.Pretty much just reading the powerpoint slides. The prof. claimed that he would include something he talked in the lecture in the exams but he really did not have any points other than those in the slides.I think the content is good but boring, so people easily fall asleep xdd. But I think overall is very good! The course mainly teaches some philosiphy knowledege which may make you feel confuse but I  think is useful.I think the professor is quite good and nice! He is so funny and humble. He will ask our opinions of his class and give improvements!Content is focused on mostly theoretical and big concept ideas on how Sci, Tech and Business works and their interdependence with one another. There are lots of examples and supplementary reading to expand on topics. Not particularly hard, but there is a lot of content to memorize.Prof is passionate about subject and makes the lectures much more interesting. He speaks clearly, loudly (maybe a bit too loud), and often asks students if we have understood his point. Also provides 5 minutes breaks in between with music to break up the long lectures. He also shows some videos or scenes from movies as a humorous way to explain or show a topic.It is about the relations between science, technology and business.Prof is great and the class is not boring. There will be videos shown which make the class more fun.Hard to get a good grade as there are lots of people studying the course. Insufficient time is given to students for the midterm exam.There are readings every week and iprs will be used to take attendance every lesson. The readings are very long with lots of difficult words. The iprs questions answered will also be counted for your final grade.This course is about some theories and concepts raised by scientists, definitions of different business models and history of Hong Kong S&T development etc."
1392,Some concepts are quite abstract and difficult to understand.He is the best professor that I have ever met. His english accent is amazing. He tried his best to make students feel less bored during lectures. He gave us a 10-min break every time and played some pop music. He even gave us candies at Halloween.
1393,"He is willing to answer students' questions after class and explain thoroughly. He also respects students' opinions as he had a course review after midterm and asked us how to improve his teaching and adjust the exam format.introduces newly emerging ideas that are central to the field of science, technology and society (STS) and considers their applications to business practices"
1394,Before midterm:
1395,"-What is Science, Technology and Innovation"
1396,-Industrial Revolution
1397,"i believe this part is more difficult than the other taught after midterm coz those definition of Science, Technology and Innovation couldn't only just be memorized but also need to imply them in exam also the historical background of IR has quite a lot to memorized"
1398,After MT
1399,- Mainly case study on Innovation and Business
1400,Not difficult coz mostly common sense and issues related to our livesVery passionate.
1401,"Pronunciation is very loud and clear and his English is very proficient in terms of teaching. I like that he adds a break for every lesson and play some music suggested by students.The content includes topics on Science, origin of science, technology, relation between science and technology, types of technologies, innovation, industrial revolution, system model of innovation, diffusion of innovation, innovation and businesses, R&D."
1402,"The course covers quite a lot. It might become boring for a few lectures, but the professor tries to keep it interesting, has mini breaks every class + 1 PRS question per class.Prof. Sharif is very good. He doesn't change the content too much from previous semesters. Gives out a few sample questions to practice before the midterm and final.Before Midterm: Approach in understanding the nature of science, influence of technology on Business, Industrial Revolution, Industrial  Leadership in Pacific Rim"
1403,"After Midterm: Relevance of Science and Technology for Economic Growth, Business Innovation, Interdependence and Diffusion of Science, Technology and Business, Managing Research and Development Function (Final Cumulative)"
1404,"The content is quite insightful, given a 13-week schedule is quite compact and sometimes the course moves quickly. However the material is not hard to understand so picking up is easy.Prof. Sharif is one of the most enthusiastic lecturers in HKUST. His lectures are often relaxing but effective. He is able to pin point some important information and successfully delivered to us."
1405,There are some video watching (some in Cantonese and some in English) during lectures which helps explain his point.
1406,"Most importantly, the professor is willing to listen to students' opinion on this course and make adjustment to it. This is valuable.things that you learn from this course may not be very useful"
1407,but some of the theories are quite fun to know aboutthe professor teaches very well
1408,- ppt is easy to follow
1409,- have breaks for each lecture
1410,- a lot of examples are provided so that you should be able to understand the content easily
1411,**Professor is very kind!!
1412,EXAM:
1413,- All MC questions so memorization is not emphasised (in fact understanding is much more important)
1414,- have readings for midterm (quite demanding)The course is mainly about how Science and Technology related to Business. It is not difficult to understand the concepts.
1415,"There are also readings provided per week. Questions about the articles will be asked in mid-term so it is quite important to read them. However they wont be in in final exams.Teaching of Professor Sharif explains quite well with a lot of daily life examples to illustrate the ideas and the principle implications. Also he is very willing to listen to students' opinions. However, he speaks a bit too fast and too loud.As it is a basic course , most of the contents are quite easy."
1416,The topics are quite boring and don't expect too much can be learnt from the course.Prof. Naubahar is very humorous.
1417,Likes to play songs during breaks.
1418,"Very responsive to your email messagesThe class content are pretty easy to understand. I guess a slightly larger portion of the contents are on technology & science, rather than business.The professor is really passionate, he tends to explain concepts clearly in class.Grades are okay if you put an adequate amount of time of reviewing course materials. There will be in-class PRS that affects your final grading as well.Daily workload are really light. It goes heavier, but manageable when it comes to midterms (need to study lecture notes, readings and handouts), but other than that, not much assignment/ daily work.Contains quite a lot of information in each PowerPoint and you have to understand some technical in order to get the marks."
1419,"There are many videos help you understand the materials and sometimes they are quite long and spent much of class time.Interesting professor, very passionate"
1420,He gives clear outline of the course and he explains much about each topic.Science Tech Business
1421,"Each component above contains around 3 PPT notes.  Not really hard to understandthe professor is chill, interesting to some extent.PRS = 15"
1422,Mid term = 40
1423,"Final = 45It really depends on what grade you want.  I would say you need to really work quite hard in order to get a B+ or above.  The workload mainly comes from the readings.  A lot.  I mean really A LOT.  But if you only aim for a C+/B-, this course is quite easy for you cuz what you need to do is read the ppt.The course on how science and technology are related to business. It uses different economic modal to analyse the relation between S&T and business in different region or country. Numerous examples and case studies are discussed in class.SHARIF, Naubahar is the most passionate professor in HKUST I have ever met. His english as well as cantonese pronunciation is accurate and clear. He cares about the need of student and uses different phrases and examples to illustrate some abstract  concept to students. He will also give breaks every lectures.The distribution of the science, technology and business are balance, but science and technology are little bit more than business."
1424,"The content is interesting and if you can understand the main concept, it is not a lot to remember."
1425,"The part about the history is the most boring, while other is ok.Prof. Naubahar is a very humorous person, 2 hours lecture is very fast to be completed. He asked ""Did I speak so fast?"" frequently, and repeat and repeat again if he saw student did not give response to him. So, give response to his question, otherwise you will listen the repeated content again and again. And that part of content will be display in PRS question in the next lecture.Mostly definitions of concepts, but definitions are important as the course examines you on the understanding of specific terms mentioned in class."
1426,"Before midterm and final, the professor will send a document consisting of sample questions. Remember to read through it as some similar questions may be seen in the actual exams.Nice professor who is helpful and responds to emails efficiently"
1427,"Likes to play songs from youtube during breaksMost of the content are definitions and quite lengthy. You can just recite all of it and go for exam.Professor is very nice and I think his accent is comparatively better than other UST professors. If you have any questions, you can feel free to ask him or send emails to him.The lengthy content includes scientific methods, innovations, industrial revolution and interdependence between science, technology and business. The topics are quite boring and don't expect too much to be learnt from the course.Indian professor who can speak Cantonese fluently and with great English accent. He plays songs suggested by students before the lectures and at the break. You can send whatever songs you like to his email. But he likes to speak loud suddenly and walk through the whole lecture theatre to draw attention from students.Good content, syllabus adequately covers all basic topic in comparative politics.  Can help you understand more about the political scene around the world.  Prof also added some new content according to happenings at that time and it was interestingGood and very kind teacher, very willing to help students, no attendance taking but I feel motivated to attend most lessons.  A lot of real world examples in the course.Mainly the content comes from the textbook and there are around 12-14 topics throughout the semester. These topics contain a lot of basics in political science such as basic game theory in political science, democratic system, democratization, voting system, political censorship, resource curse etc.Prof. Jean HONG has great teaching skills. She's good at generalizing the content and explain the most interesting/important part to us and it's really helpful to understand the political world and political science. She's serious in teaching and appears demanding, but she's actually really nice and kind to answer questions and solve our problems.comprehensive teaching in basic aspects of politics"
1428,not very difficult even if you are not very good in politics! the textbook will help to understand the topicsnice prof!!!! not very stressful
1429,"a relaxing environmentThe content covers many new concepts, may be a little much for students without any prior knowledge (like me).Very good, the professor explains the concepts very clear. He is also quite humorous. There is a 10 minutes ""tea break"" in the middle of each class, which is great idea.got 1 SD above average in both midterm and final"

1454,"quite interesting especially for those who loves politics.Loving the lesson. I want to investigate more on politics after the lessons.A really refreshing course completely new perspective on politics.The professor makes the class so enlightening and enjoyable. Expect great times of relaxation and deep thinking in this course. And hug the professor hahaha.Exams are pretty adequately written and graded. Prior to exam, the prof will help you review a little bit which is super helpful. Just put your efforts, you will see your result.Fair workload. I should say small but it's such a great experience studying on regime type and development structure with my team buddies.The course is about comparative politics. Professor would talk about elections, inequality, parties and some other interesting topics. You can actually learn a lot from the election part. Game theories are the easiest part to understand.Professor is cute and considerate. She's from South Korea.It's really interesting if you would like to know more about how technologies evolve and why each of them evolve in a certain way."
1455,Sometimes when you think about it it's fascinating.
1456,Although if you are not a guy who's obsessed into history kind of stuff and remembering different facts and years you might find the content to be a bit boring some of the time but it should be fine.
1457,The course is more about understanding concepts than recalling facts but either should be rather easy
1458,the professor play the dankest songs at the start of every lesson ayyyy lmao
1459,"hey look at me i am trying to get that meter thingy into the satisfactory range its so close omg will the colour change it's getting closer and closer and it looks like it's g----oh shoot it changes into that eyegasm green color and it feels like im breathing in the freshest air in the universe and then all different kind of plants dance around me ty based ustspace for this amazing thermometerLike, the professor is really passionate and make jokes all the time. Will get taught again 11/10related to real life issue, content are clear and easy to understand. Each lesson include one new topic. If you understand all the basic contents, it is not hard to answer the questions and get high marks.The whole atmosphere is quite good and interacting, the professor is funny. He is a top professor in HKUST.The course explores some of the interactions between science, technology and work. Topics include Technology, Power, and the Foundations of the Industrial Workplace, Technology and Power, Scientific Management, Machines and Deskilling.Nice professor, his powerpoint are precise and to the point. He is willing to answer any of the questions you have and shows his passion. He is sometimes funny and uses Cantonese time to time to tell those jokes.Intro and overview"

1474,"There are 5 lecture sessions assigned for doing the group discussion reports. You have to finish the discussion report by the end of the class time.The whole course is divided among four major sections, and each lecture covers one certain topic."
1475,It generally speaks about the relationship between society and technology and how each of those is capable of shaping and be shaped by the other.
1476,"Covers topics like Industrial Revolution, Innovation models, Technological Networks, Security and Politics, Governance..."
1477,"I personally really enjoyed the topics and thought they were quite interesting.Mr. Baark is ex-ce-llent. Totally love his teaching style. He explains everything in quite a lot of detail, is very funny during the lectures and is also happy to help you with any questions you might have. You can also send him an email if you have any doubt and he often replies quite fast."
1478,"TAs were also great, very friendly, and willing to help you out.The title of the course describes the content of the course pretty precisely. There are some terms and concepts introduced but most of the content is just common sense.

1506,Final Review
1507,This course should provide you with fundamental knowledge about the interaction of science and technology in our life which will help you become more mindful of the mutual influence of science and technology on society.The professor assessed our understandings by asking us to apply the factual and conceptual knowledge we had learnt to case study analysis. This was done through case studies included in mid-term and final exams and through the assessment of case study reports from group discussion in class.
1508,"During lectures, he would illustrate the mutual influence of technology and society with case studies and/or videos, and discuss those with students in class."

1545,His ppt slides are also very easy to follow
1546,There is quite a lot of interaction between him and the students (compared to other courses I have taken)
1547,"He is going to retire soon in 1-2 years so hurry up if you want to take his courseThe course mainly focuses on the relationship between science&technology and society(people): how science and technology are embedded within the society and vice versa. The topics cover definition and history of science and technology, how they are interrelated, concepts such as technological networks and path dependence, and how technology influences and is influenced by gender, environment, ethics and security.The instructor is from Denmark and speaks good English. He is very friendly, approachable and often tries to make a comfortable atmosphere by joking and sometimes seeking thoughts from students. He is a democratic person; he is very willing to accept and reflect students' opinions.The content of this course is very easy to digest. It can be somewhat boring at the beginning but it gets more interesting afterwards."
1548,"It starts off talking about history of science and technology and how technology has been developed throughout time, then it introduces to some technical terms and the process of adapting a technology to a new environment or society.Prof. Baark is very nice. He always plays songs at before starting and jokes throughout the lecture. I think he was pretty clear when explaining the concepts and tries to keep you engaged by asking some questions.A little knowledge from many diferent fields, can get an introduction of different issues and the linkage between them."
1549,"Some of the concepts are really interesting, like innovation models, technological networks etc.The professor is quite funny and I can see that he put a lot of effort in preparing the lessons and tried to make the lectures not as boring."
1550,"There are music / funny videos before each lecture, and some of them are very nice :D"
1551,"There is no attendance requirement, but the in-class PRS is kind of an indicator.Here is the objectives in the syllabus:"
1552,"""The course aims to provide students with theoretical and conceptual tools to understand the way scientific and technological decisions are made, and the effects that these decisions in turn have on social development. It will encourage students to analyse technology from different perspectives, to ask informed questions about the driving forces of science and technology, and to form their own opinions about the role of science and technology in our contemporary society."""
1553,"In this course, I mostly learned about history in the first half semester, and some easy theoritical stuffs in the second half semester."
1554,"Pretty interesting, and what you will learn is usually in line with common sense.He is quite good, and very nice. He always plays his favorite songs in the beginning of the lessons. He was always trying to make the class interesting, although sadly, he sometimes failed to do it. Overall, he was a very kind person.Mainly talks about the history of technological development from the Stone Age all the way up to the Industrial Revolution and now. Covers concepts such as technological momentum, social lag and the socio-technological system, which are very straight-forward and assessed many many MANY times in the final. In other words, as long as you understand a concept, you can get many questions correct in a row as they are basically asking about the same thing. The midterm and final both consist of multiple choice questions only, usually providing a scenario and asking you the name of the relevant concept. The most tricky part is that you have to recite the complete history of technology covered in the course down to the very last detail, as even the name of a prehistorical species mentioned in the first ppt slide of the first lecture may be assessed in the final. You also have to read the whole textbook provided on the course website, as some questions will be asked.Prof. Baark is a nice person, he sometimes jokes about himself during lessons and he even gave us cookies made by his wife. However, his talking speed is very slow and monotone so students may have to try harder to focus for a long period of time.Lectures are all about the 3 elements as stated in the course title: Society, Science and technology. It includes some history at the beginning and quite boring at all. After a few lectures, you may learn some terms about the topic and it's especially important for the exam and the group work essay. The content is very simple in overall.He speaks english very slow but he's nice. He is a responsible professor and try to be funny in class.The course mainly taught about how society affects technological development. A bit like history lesson so as level 1 course."
1555,"There is a free online textbook and the content will be tested.The professor will teach with powerpoint and that's all the content will be tested. The videos will mainly be used in PRS but won't appeared in exam, so no need to spend a lot of time to watch them.Learn about how the Chinese communist party was established in this course!! It is an interesting lesson."
1556,The assigned reading was interesting as well.He is very passionate about the course content and it shows through his teaching. It is interesting to hear about his stories of how he was in the cultural revolution.
1557,"He teaches using marking pen on the whiteboard. Some of it is blow water.This course is talking about the change of party-state system in different period. What Mao and Deng did have affect the development of the party-state system. Also, the course had talked about the characteristic of the party-state system.Prof's English is hard to understand and his teaching is boring. Sometimes he is making some jokes, which quit funny. But most of the time is boringYou are going to do a lot of readings, and you better already know a lot about Chinese and Communist history or you will be very very very painful in this course.Don't ask stupid questions, he speaks in a fun accent, which shouldn't be a problem for most. He knows well about Chinese history for sure but sometimes it is difficult to follow what he is talking about.The content is general about the rise of Marxism, Lenin, German-like ROC system, the early stage of the PRC and comtempory China after 1989. You will love it as long as you are interested in communism or China's politics.The prof never uses any PPT, cause he said there are new things happened everyday. Actually he always tells us some related news happened a fews days before the lecture. He gives lecture just like telling a story, follwing the timeline, with a weird accent. He always asks us to raise question during the lecture, and remind us to do the readings on the reading list he given.At the beginning (before the midterm) it went through some basic economic concepts which has been taught in high school."
1558,The midterm covers:
1559,1. Law of Demand
1560,2. Demand and Supply
1561,3. Equilibrium and efficiency
1562,4. Externality
1563,5. Coasm Theorem
1564,6. Public goods
1565,"If you are a local student and studied ECON in DSE, those should be easy. But be careful about the efficiency part in midterm, because the question the prof asked about externality and efficiency is quite complicated for me."
1566,"After the midterm, the topics taught are new to me."
1567,The final covers:
1568,1. Valuing the environment
1569,"(This part is about how to measure the value of a good which does not have a market price. i.e. Hedonic approach, travel cost modelling and avoidance costs)"
1570,2. VSL (Value of a Statistical Life)
1571,(Trying to estimate a single human life in the society and discussion on the ethical issue)
1572,3. Benefit-Cost Analysis
1573,"(A method to determine whether we should implement a policy or not, a process to go through in policy making)"
1574,4. Environmental and Health
1575,(Link environmental risk to human health and quantify the effect with the above methods)
1576,5. Markets with asymmetric information
1577,"(the lemon effect, moral hazard and averse selection)"
1578,6. Climate change and its effect in China
1579,7. Second Best Theoryquite good i think
1580,The prof likes to ask question in the lesson.
1581,"Clear voice and providing enough material for you to study the exam.The content is extremely rich... (overly rich) When you are studying for the finals, you will find yourself cursing at the fat presentation slides that you need to study. Otherwise, I think I learned a lot of useful stuff in this course.I don't know. This must be controversial. But first of all, most of the students do not listen to the lecture. There are a few reasons why:"
1582,1) The professor's voice is extremely boring... The content isn't but his voice is very calming.
1583,"2) The seat in the lecture hall is too comfortable. You sit back in that chair, you forget you are taking a lecture."
1584,"3) I played games like ""Gunner"" and ""Shovel Knight"" throughout the course.Majority of topics involve basic economic background, it may not be a great choice to some who have no economic background at all."
1585,"Overall the lessons were fun and content is easy to comprehend.Professor speaks fluent English and teaches pretty well in classes even if most students were not very responsive. He is very nice so feel free to ask about content or materials taught in lessons.The instructor first teaches the basics of microeconomics, like supply and demand, price ceiling and price floors, cs and ps and so on, people with dse econ background can easily follow the course. Later he teaches monopoly and externalities and so on. I think the content is interesting but the instructor teaches quite fast.instructor speaks well in english and people are generally not sleepy in class, he doesn't just follow the powerpoint and read aloud but add his own explanations and examples, he allows class discussions and will hear your suggestions on how to improve the course.Use some basic economic models and concepts to analyze environmental and health issues (Actually it is more similar to econ course).  Students with basic economics concept may find it easier.Overall, he teaches quite well.  As our class misses several class due to public holiday, so he taught faster after midterm exam, in which students without basic econ background may hard to follow.  But his notes are easy to follow and understand, and he is willing to answer students' question and explain the concepts clearly after class.The content is quite interesting but there are lots of cases to review and studied. You have to remember slight details of the cases and the law principles involved.Teaching is a little bit boring but the professor clearly illustrated the concepts. There are a lot of things that he didn't put into the slide so pay attention.Many concepts to memorize. But some of them are common sense. The content is rich. There are also reading materials and tutorial materials."
1586,They are
1587,"Historical Development, Customs and Treaties , States and International Organizations ,International Human Rights ,:Sea, Air, Space Law ,Environmental Law , The Use of Force,Peaceful Settlement of Disputes,Presentation of student papers.The professor is excellent. He gives out rich content. Make sure you understand all concepts. His English is good but simple, and understandable. He did provide lecture videos. But better attend lectures.SOSC1270 introduces the fundamentals of International Law. I personally would interpret it as a 'history' course rather than a law course as a great portion of the course simply outlines the historical development of International law in different areas (such as Human Rights, Territory, Pollution, Nuclear Safety, Armed Conflicts ......), which means there are not many (or very few) legal principles to be remembered."
1588,"There are some suggested readings provided in the course but they are not necessary. You can do simply rely on the Lecture Notes because most of the questions were extracted from there (but some questions will be modified to assess the clarity of your concepts)Professor Barry Sautman is one of the very good professors I have met in HKUST. He is a cheerful old person with charisma. In exam 1, he welcomes some of the students to join the course (because many students haven't shown up in any classes before and their participation of Exam 1 is their first time to step into the class)"
1589,"Although he speaks quite boring and most of the students don't attend his classes, I would say he is a wise person and you would know more about how states deal with each other, and some mechanisms on how global community is solving problems internationally. (yeah it is a good 1000-level course)The content is broad and fundamental. A number of cases would be discussed under every topic. Took this course to get a taste of law and liked it!One of the best in UST, teaching is vey clear and fun. Barry is so knowledgable in this area that he could answer any questions raised by students and explained in details.it covers some fundamental  topics of int law like law of see, use of force,envo law........ you will learn what an introduction should havesometimes boring sometimes interesting( story and case time)"
1590,"Barry is nice and he is willing to answer all your questions1. 50% mid term, 50% final OR"
1591,"2.50 % 2 exams, 50% paper+presentation (popular as the avg grade is higher than doing exam)"
1592,I did not sign up for paper and I kind of messed up the midterm (to me yes) but I did well in the final. I got A-.
1593,BUT
1594,"Some friends think that the grading sucks, they all got C range. SO IT DEPENDS."
1595,"ps, usually there are ppl get full points for mc exams but no one ever get full marks ( at least for the 2 exams I experienced. Obviously, it is NOT EASY.0 workload in terms of assignment but you have to really figure out all the concepts and cases and this takes timeInteresting for those who would like to understand more of international law in historical examples around the globe. Not that interesting for those who regard it as ""memorizing"" work."

1625,"Student Presentations' topicsBarry is very knowledgeable in this area and willing to answer students' questions (((though not many :) but the powerpoint slides may be a bit messy and may need to get organized by yourself.Interesting concepts about international law, especially if you like to learn about international relationships? The course felt more like a history course to me than law since it's more about how the int. law we use today were derived from past cases. I personally didn't like history in highschool, but this course was interesting because it didn't require memorisation of dates and names and places but rather focused on 'what' and 'how' and 'why'.Professor explains case studies really easily and recaps previous cases when they are addressed later in the lectures. The powerpoint has all the content both in English and Chinese but I think listening to the professor is much easier to comprehend the concepts than just reading lecture notes. He speaks slowly and very clearly, asks if there are any questions during lectures. good lecture environment.All material needed for the midterm and final is in the lectures. His explanations are very easy to understand and quite concise. Content is very rich and a lot is covered without realising. Knows when to provide more explanations and when it's not needed."
1626,Interesting content if you enjoy international relations. Covers the history of international law and its evolution. Very relevant to important topics that appear on world news today.
1627,"Lecture notes, tutorials and exam papers are offered in both English and Chinese."
1628,"The professor also says that you have an advantage if you study the content in Chinese, as the legal terms are much more specific than in English.Professor has obviously taught this this material for a long time. Delivery seems repeated and scripted, but is also what makes his explanations quite concise."
1629,"Unfortunately, the professor speaks rather slowly. Always seems a bit disappointed with the students' overall lack of engagement and participation."
1630,"Attended most lectures, but find that the lecture videos are much better. Easier to focus and follow when put on 1.5x speed.Content is quite interesting and close to daily lives. To students that like reading or English or societal issues, this course is for you. All powerpoint slides are covered in words and cases to be studied. But when doing a revision, there is far too much content to remember...Lectures are honestly quite boring. However, they do put up lecture videos on canvas so you can speed up the video to 1.5x for better lecture experience (so it would be less boring and easier to catch up). Anyways I recommend using lecture videos instead of going to class since you can always pause when you are not sure or can't catch up on some crucial cases. You need to note them down for further revision.personally i dont think its that interesting"
1631,though hes filled the course with loads of contents and good examples
1632,the powerpoint doesnt even include half of his contents in class
1633,but there're videos for review even if you skip the lessons so thats quite nicejust boring
1634,the contents are not really good
1635,he looks like einstein and speaks very slowly
1636,thus makes it super boring
1637,but he's a nice guy
1638,just may not be a very engaging lecturerTopics to be covered:
1639,History of IL;

1648,many extra cases are discussed during the lesson
1649,Powerpoint included both Chinese and English

1661,"*lecture notes; tutorial notes, lecture videos will be uploaded on Canvas so don't panicThe course is about the basic knowledge about International Law, from which you can have a higher understanding to the current global political situation."
1662,There are 8 topics:
1663,1. History ¡ª Development of I.L.
1664,"2. States ¡ª Definition, constitution of a states"
1665,3. Treaties ¡ª how states make treaties and rules about a treaty

1670,8. Use of Force ¡ª What are the rules in war time
1671,Memorisation is necessary: mainly the principles behind each cases on international law level.
1672,"In the last 2 weeks, there will be students to present their project in these topics, analysing the current affairs.The teaching is good for your deeper  learning into this course, because professor talks a lot about the current issues and many other cases out of the syllabus to help your understanding of the materials. However, the powerpoints are not friendly to understand, so this may affect your study, especially before the exam.Very rich. In other words, many things need to be memorised."
1673,Teaching assistants are very nice. They provide additional notes and tutorials which are much more understandable and interesting.
1674,"However, sometimes the concept on the tutorial notes and powerpoint may be contradicted...Little interaction during the lesson. Fast spoken English. Need to take many notes. Powerpoint is hard to read as the main points will not be emphasised.History of International Law"
1675,States
1676,Treaties
1677,Human Rights
1678,Sea
1679,Environment
1680,Use of Force
1681,Peaceful settlement
1682,"The topics are quite interesting. They are all basically about the history and the reasons how the laws evolved. It is not like memorizing the status of laws.The professor is very fluent in English. However, in terms of lecture, I feel like he is just reading through the powerpoints. It seems like powerpoint is like a script of his speech. There is no break between lectures and information is flooding, which makes you bit exhausted."
1683,"I really like the powerpoints from TAs. They organized information very clearly and I really liked it. It will be very useful for you to attend tutorials.Mainly focus on history and principles of international law. Many cases are included under different topics. While the professor stressed that we don't need to remember factual details but just understand principles of these cases, you still have to remember some facts of them because in the exams, questions will be asking what is the principle demonstrated in these cases but nearly none of the details of the case except for its name is given.Pretty good. Powerpoint are mainly in point forms and not really that easy to understand by reading on your own. Professors link different points well so you can remember easily during lectures and tutorials slides are pretty useful too.Basic introduction to International Law (IL)."
1684,Topics:
1685,Historical development of IL

1690,Environmental Law
1691,Use of Force
1692,Peaceful Settlement of Disputes
1693,The level of difficulty is very basic. No previous knowledge of any subject is required.
1694,"Topics are interesting and made relevant by the use of many recent, real-life IL cases to demonstrate different laws."
1695,"All lecture PPTs, tutorial PPTs, student presentations, exam questions, and multiple choice options are provided in both English and Chinese.The professor is an excellent lecturer, very enthusiastic and interesting. Explains all concepts very clearly and slowly, and helpful to answer any questions."
1696,"All lectures are recorded and uploaded on Canvas, but it's worth attending in the lecture theatre if you have time."
1697,"There are optional weekly tutorials in English and Chinese just to recap the week's lecture, not necessary to attend. Tutorial PPTs are also uploaded."
1698,"The professor holds 1-hour long review sessions in a classroom the night before the midterm and the final, these are very helpful especially if you haven't been attending lectures. Many questions and tips discussed are similar to the exam questions.The lessons are quite easy to understand and it is quite simple to know what is the lecture mainly tells about."
1699,"It is mainly a introduction class, rather than a detailed law class."
1700,We had gone through these sections:
1701,History
1702,Treaties and customary international law
1703,States
1704,Human Rights and I.O.s
1705,"Sea, Air and Outer Space"
1706,Environment and Global warming
1707,Conflict and War
1708,"Peaceful settlementTeaching is really interesting and the teacher often talks about his own experience, which is really great."
1709,"Also, there is video prepared for you after the class so that you can miss some classes if it is impossible for you to attend the class on time."
1710,"Extra tutorial classes are prepared both in English and Cantonese, thus you can choose whatever you like.The course focus on basic theory on International Law. About History, Treaties, States, Human Rights, Law of Sea, Air and Outerspace, Environmental Law, Use of Force and Peaceful Settlement. Student can also apply for writing essay on International Law and present it on class. Maximum 9 groups comprise of 2 students will be selected.Prof. Sautman is passionate about teaching as he kept on asking student for raising questions although students are not quite willing to ask. However the lecture ppt are not well organized and the Chinese translation is not accurate. Also, professor talked about a lot of extra material not included in the lecture powerpoint, but these materials are going to be asked in the exam. So attend lesson for good grade."
1711,"There are also an English tutorial section and a Chinese tutorial section, Kevin, the TA for English tutorial section, prepare a detailed tutorial powerpoint which is better than the lecture powerpoint in my opinion.the entire course will cover:"
1712,1. History
1713,2. Treaties
1714,3. States
1715,4. Human Rights
1716,(tested in exam 1; midterm)
1717,"5. Sea, Air, and Outer Space"
1718,6. Environment
1719,7. Use of Force
1720,8. Peaceful Settlement
1721,(tested in exam 2; final)
1722,"you really will learn sth if you're interested in social science, and especially law-related stuff and international relations."
1723,"ppt slides are bilingual, although there will sometimes be translation mistakes. lecture videos are offered through canvas; no attendance taking."
1724,"recommend watching those videos sth like one or two weeks before exams in 2.0x speed.the pace of teaching is a bit slow, and the ppt slides are not really up to date."
1725,"yet, the professor is a nice Canadian professor... like his accent a lot."
1726,"btw, he will reply students' email pretty fast and with detailed explanation/answers!Talk about the basic concepts of the International Law. It is fruitful."
1727,"The content of the course includes History of international law, Treaties, States, Human rights, The law of sea, air and outer space, Environment, Use of force, and Peaceful settlement.The professor is very great. He would give many examples and real cases to make sure the students can understand the concepts."
1728,"He is very nice, and can teach clearly. He usually encourages students to ask questions in the lecture.This course will teach you some basic knowledge of international law, including definition, enactment and some of it. Yet, you won't learn much based on the materials provided in the lesson. If you really want to know more about this IL, you need to read the reading materials on your own and it is completely useless for the quiz and examination.Honestly, I think the teaching is quite boring and it does not only because of the professor. As people do not need to take attendance in this course, you will soon find that there are not many people left in the lecture. Also, all the questions asked in the examination can be found in the notes provided so you can totally study it on your own and still have a good grading. That makes the whole atmosphere a little bit boring.Very interesting"

Just so many case and example to remember. If you r interested in history maybe you will enjoy.The instructor share alot of related cases and history. He teaches quite well, easy to follow and understand. He welcome discussions in class and sometimes very political discussions in class.Content:"

1746,"In fact, this course is just a 1xxx level course, which means it is quite easy. The course only focuses on the basic concepts, which means that you do not need to memorise a lot of things. Attending the class, you will be safe.One of the best professors in ust who is willing to answer students' questions in class or after the lesson. He is really familiar with this topic and used a lot of examples in class. He can clearly deliver the ideas to you so that it is not quite hard to pick up all the things. Also the TA is really good. There will be some supplementary tutorial held by the TA to help students fully understand the topics and the concepts.Good class to equip people with a common sense of law. It covers a lot of topics such as human rights, sea, air, environment, etc. Not suitable for those who have no interest in law though.Professor is very nice! Will continue to do UROP with him this semester.The course give you a lot of freedom, no attendance will be taken for both tutorial and lectures.Workload is also really low, with only one mid term and one final, both consist of MC questions only which make it a really low workload course. Your grade will be based 100% on your exam, however, you can write a voluntary essays and consist 50% of your grade, so exam will only consist of 50%."
1747,"For each units, professors will prepare a power point with main-points. Before exam, lectures videos will be provided. A special thing is for every material(including power point or exam etc.) It will provide Chinese translation."
1748,"However, for students like me, I find the lectures a bit boring as those cases and law is not so close to our daily life.The teacher is pretty humorous and can also answers most questions that the students has raise up. For teaching assistance, their English may not be that good, so when I attend the English tutorial session, it is not hard to notice the TA is having a hard time when presenting. However, their power point is pretty details and can help review the points mentioned and learnt during lectures.Mid terms and finals are all multiple choices.Lessons were all recorded, attendance is not required. Many things mentioned during the class are out of syllabus,  just remember to study the powerpoint and be really familiar with the cases.It's content focus on different aspects of international law. It got a quite sensible logic flow. From the history of International laws tp environmental aspects, military aspects, world peaces etc."
1749,The major revision point is to revise how the examples' related to the law principle. The details of each example are not required to recite. Clearly understanding is needed.The course is fun if you are interested in law. The professor use many examples to explain the principle or law.
1750,"If you are a bit confused in the course content, it is pretty common for students to raise questions."
1751,"And the tutorials are basically act as weekly review of lesson.It is quite inreresting if you are interested in law. It touched different apsects in law around the world and listed many cases and examples. You may need to know the development on a specific law as well.It is one of the best pof. I have ever met.  His teaching is very clear and concise, and very interesting as well, since he will not simply read out the power-point, which a lot pof. do.mainly concerns international affairs and of course, international law. Can learn a lot about the history of different countries, and get some basic concepts in I law. good to boarden your horizon."
1752,"1 mid term, 1 final, optional paper with 1 partner.Prof Sautman teaches quite well. Class is interesting. But TAs can't help you much, probably because they don't know much about international law too.It is quite inreresting if you are interested in law. It touched different apsects in law around the world and listed many cases and examples. You may need to know the development on a specific law as well.Barry is a very highly-qualified professor and he made jokes in class as well. You don't need to attend class since there were lecture video posted after the class. You may watch those videos few days before the exam and then you can get a decent grade.Very interesting content: covers legal aspects of sea, land, sky, weapon regulations, and many other fields in a very short but informative class. For those who are interested in international affairs, this is probably the best class that UST has to offer. Those interested in MUN can also consider taking this class as this class provides a lot of background knowledge.Barry Sautman is one of the better professors in the SS deparment. This class took place in a lecture theater, but his voice is so audible that no form of auditory aid is needed. Sautman carries the class at an appropriate pace, and is always eager to answer students' questions. He is a lawyer who has advanced knowledge in the legal career, which is very rare in this university.MIDTERM TOPICS:"

1763,"Generally, really interesting but dense topics."
1764,"The course tests you on understanding of concepts, but memorization is needed as well, especially of key case studies and their significance in international law.Professor Sautman's teaching is very clear, and he is a very engaging lecturer. He encourages students to ask questions during and after the lectures, and he answers every question very well. He definitely has a lot of knowledge on and experience in the field."
1765,"The TAs' optional tutorials were sometimes helpful in summarizing. The practice questions could be confusing at times, though. One time the TA gave us an answer we debated, only to have the answer changed once it was uploaded on Canvas.Probably the best course in UST for people interested in International Relations theory or who have some sort of background in law. Topics covered include treaties and customs, states and international organisations, human rights, sea, air and space law, environmental law and the use of force.Brilliant professor - he's a mildly funny Canadian and hence enjoys making occasional (hilarious) jabs at US politics. Cites engaging examples from current world news, integrates case studies with theory and manages to make a topics that could've been boring as heck interesting. He tends to be quite scatty and unstructured though in that his powerpoints are just random points (with bilingual translations, I'll give him that)."
1766,"His TAs aren't the best though - their accents make the (optional) tutorials quite slow and difficult to understand, although their powerpoints are usually fantastically structured.The course content is not difficult which overlaps some with my high school courses. It Covers a wide range introdutory level content of politics.I really enjoy the lectures. The content and the teaching style are intriguing.25 percent midterm,40 percent final,25 percent essay, and 10 percent participation."
1767,"Exams contain MC and Short questions. There are 5 pop-up quizs accounted for 2 percent grade each and up to 5 percent bonus depands on your participation in the lectures. The overall grading is quite fair. I got over half sd in the midterm and around 1sd in the final ending up an A-.I think even in the rather intense summer term there's not too much to handle. Just need to study for the exams and write one essay.The course is split into two parts. One is some basic concepts on politics, like what is democracy, what is freedom, and different kinds of ideologies. The second part is the actual practise of politics like voting. Not only basic concepts, but also critical analysis on those topics to ensure that you always find both the positive and negative sides for every idea.The teaching is very good. As a local students, you will find the learning material familiar because jamesbb always use local issues to demonstrate the ideas taught in class.The contents are quite easy to understand.Students are required to finish a group project,a mid term exam and a final exam.The instructor was kind and willing to answer questions,some video clips will be provided in the lesson. .The exams are not difficult,the questions are mainly focus on the reading materials and powerpoint."

1771,"The grade is quite good for me.You have to read about 40 pages of reading materials for a week,but they are quite easy to understand.James uses a lot of real life exams to demonstrate the concepts learnt in class. If James goes over a concept twice in different lectures I'd probably take that down as something that'll definitely come up in the final."
1772,"If you do all the readings and understand all the lecture slides you'll probably be good at this course. Not extremely difficult content as this is only poli sci 101.Kinda boring, a lot of the time he just goes over what's written in the lecture slides so there's no real value in sitting in the lecture unless you want to ask him questions in the lecture. (I would go early if you ask questions or at the end of class as he will explain your question very thoroughly and this may result in class going over time)Very brief overview of politics,history and some application of political theory in real life. Not new things but of course there are a lots of input that can enhance your knowledege about politics including the political system, parties, role of governement and different officials. If you are interested in understanding and look into the local politic in more dimensions, you should try this course.James is a very pasionated instructor that can keep you interested in politics. To be honest i am not a friend of politics, but i am a fan of James Wong after taking the course.Political theories and comparative politics."
1773,"Discussed concepts about state,power,freedom,democracy,idealogies and etc. Also including many real world issues and examples.Wong,James K. is very enthusiatic and conscientious and has a good sense of humor. He replies emails and answers questions pretty fast.This course covers basic theories of politics. Because it is a intro course, it covers wide range of topics, so the workload might be tough. It is a good course to broaden your knowledge in social science and gives good background knowledge to understand the current political situationPr Wong is humorous. He goes over the ppt slides during the lecture time. He uses ppt slides (which are filled with words and large contents). There is usually at least one break within the lecture time.1.

Political theory looks at the normative world of politics, seeking to evaluate and recommend political arrangements through the study of concepts and ideologies. Comparative politics looks at the empirical world of politics, seeking to understand and explain political phenomena through the study of actors, institutions, and their dynamics.

1817,"Grade: A-If you are a participant in social movements, I suggest you having this course. The course introduces terms that are somewhat commonly talked in political news, but people rarely understand this well. For example, the ideology of different government, and how parties differ the state. Most importantly, the course introduces the basic concept of a state, and how it is different with a country. Based on this, Hong Kong can be consider as a state, but not a country. This perspective are quite useful inJames Wong taught quite well. He could implement the concept with the international and local news. For example, the Britexit movement was on the headlines at that time. He could really know where students will get lost in. One thing that is great is that he had printed notes each lecture. (Of cause you can download in Canvas too)Pretty informative and interesting. Many things to memorize but contents were some what useful for me to understand why various governments run differentlyGreat teaching atmosphere and fun prof. He tried to make some jokes here and there which some were effective. Very Cantonese friendly with all those Mandarin and Canto in ppts so for foreigners like myself might have some trouble understanding few concepts if you skip the lecture and try to read off ppt. Great professorIt is about the Chinese history during the cultural revolution. Focus on the internal conflict inside the party.Professor organised his teaching material and TA will help with the notes. But it would be really helpful if you can do notes quickly since no ppt is provided.The grading is fair. Professor comment a lot on the essays.Readings required. But really depends on the ways of midterm and final exam. If it is for essay, you have to do some in depth reading, not sure if the midterm is in the form of  exam.The course is about the development and the impact of the Cultural Revolution."
1818,The professor was like a story teller on CR.
1819,Lively and detail description on the relationship and the mentality of different leader like Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.
1820,The policy and the power distribution in the central government and the army was clearly illustrated and analysed.
1821,"Despite the clear explanation, there was extensive readingssssssss for you to read, which I could never finish."
1822,"If you cannot finish a thick book of reading, to SIT-IN his class will be a better alternative.The professor is knowledgeable in Cultural Revolution."
1823,"If you want to have a better understanding on Cultural Revolution or have a close reading on the required text, you have better listen to what the professor said."
1824,"If you missed his word, you better ask the people next to you or the TA , or you will find it hard to catch it up."
1825,"He is patient in giving advice to your work if you face any difficulty, he will kindly offer help to you.If you want to have some knowledge of HK politics and society, this might be excellent to you. With large amount of information(especially statistical figure), at least you will understand some serious problem  HK is facing.Prof. Sing's teaching was good, at least every local student could understand(I guess).Professor goes through several significant social issues in details with the support of empirical statistics. Students may have a better understanding of the development and critical issues of Hong Kong politics. It is one of the most inspiring course you may find in UST. You will get to know why many people claim Hong Kong as no true democracy and how injustice our political system is. If you want to know more about the place you are born and bred, and don't wanna be a 'Kong Pig', take SOSC 1661."
1826,"I think it is sometimes too difficult for foreign students and also mainland students to take this course as they do not have a solid  ground about HK social issues, politicians and celebrities. It takes time for them to get these things recognised.Ming Sing is a professor encourages students to develop their ability in critical thinking. He, as mentioned in another review, has a very clear stance and he makes his opinions, if not findings, convincing. And, he loves inviting students to have lunch with him.Hong Kong Political Development from British rule up to now"

1828,threats from China
1829,"good if you are interested in HK politicsSpeak bilingually, Cantonese and English, but a bit fast"
1830,"Lots of videos, and some questions in final exam related to the videos"
1831,"has his own stance, a bit biasedJust need to read the lectures and memorise as much as you can. Lecture notes are quite long though, so it's best not to rush it all at once."
1832,"There are other reading materials to read if you really want to ace the course.Only went to one lesson, didn't really help for me. I would recommend reading the lecture notes yourself and try to remember as much as you can.Mainly focused in how Hong Kong was governed and what were the consequences that brought by different governing style/policy."
1833,You will first learn how Hong Kong was governed in colonial time. Then move forwards to the governance of the past three Chief Executives with the Umbrella Movement as the last part of the course.
1834,"The professor has a very clear stand. If you are very sensitive to this(especially mainland students or pro-establishment), then probably you should not take this course.Teaching is really boring and the professor always spend time to ask people stop talking."
1835,"Sometimes the professor invited guests to give speech. Some of them are worth listening.Contents are easy and understandable which are mostly about current HK political trend and situation. Most of the content is common sense, local student should be easy to handle while non local student can have an in depth understanding towards HK politics.Prof Sing Ming is obviously a pro democratic the teaching is a bit biased. The lectures is kinda boring, attendance is not required, therefore the lecture hall is only 1/3 filledBy unfolding the multi-dimensions of Hong Kong 's political system, political culture, and political dynamics before and after its handover, this course aims to review the factors shaping the governance of Hong Kong. Throughout the course, intensive class interaction will be encouraged and multi-media teaching instruments will be adopted to stimulate learning.Pretty decent for me. Mostly he is objective when teaching the facts and news article about the HK politics. He will also translate some terms to students if they are not locals, which is pretty nice.Interesting topic about HK politics, including issues since 1950s. E.g. SARS, Universal suffrage, Umbrella revolutionMost of the time, Sing Ming speaks bilingually. Not an easy course for foreigners and non-local students.Most of the stedents who attempted the exam got C range."
1836,"Also, Sing Ming does not announce the result of final exam, and you can only know your grade through student centre.No workload if you choose to attempt the MC exam, which includes 55 Multiple choice question and you have to finish it in 50 minutes.A summary of HK politics."
1837,"I think every year the content of this course will change, it choose the hottest topic to teach.The teacher is like a high school teacher. You cant talk in the class or he would shout at you."
1838,"He is caring his student, he would has lunch with student.I choose to write essay but not mc. I only use 1 night to finish and have a B+. I think write essay would be easily to get high marks.There are very low workload. You no need to join any class and read the powerpoint but you can still finsh the course and get a good marks.Covers the Hong Kong political environments from post handover period to umbrella movement. Lecture based teaching with videos and guest lecture.Prof. Sing mainly conduct the lecture in English. He, sometimes, explains some local terminologies in Cantonese and usually is more detailed. However, those info. he explains in cantonese do not include in the Final ExamSome of my friends said the lectures were boring but I don't think so.A very good course for locals (or for those who understand Cantonese) to understand more about what the government is doing behind the scene. Increase your political awareness. Know more about Hong Kong.The slides suck. Unorganized, lots of formatting errors. Don't expect too much in-class. But those videos are worth to watch.Main point: Democracy!!!"
1839,"Good for people who want to know more about Hong Kong's politics, especially after the Umbrella Movement.I think he had done a good job in teaching politics, and he could provide a lot of useful information about different important events happened in Hong Kong.B- with watching some of the videos, several pages of readings, and all of the PPTs. Didn't listen to him for most of the time...Low."
1840,"Although there are many PPTs and assigned readings to read, and also a number of videos, they seems like to be useless in the exam...So it could be low if you don't read or watch all of the materials.Simple discussion on the political system and culture of Hong Kong, for instance, the electoral system. Some current news is mentioned too, such as the umbrella movement.It will be quite boring if you are not interested in politics. Besides, Prof. Sing Ming dislikes people talking during lectures, he will ask you whether you have any to share if you talk.As what written on the topic, it was totally for your interest and knowledge - you got lots of reading materials all written by the renowned professors and you will understand Hong Kong in a more dynamic way."
1841,"There are many aspects about Hong Kong including the housing problems, corruption, collusion and many other politics-related issue."
1842,"You will surely learn a lot.Sing Ming has abundant knowledge about Hong Kong political dynamics. However, it seems that he didn't prepare much before his lecture and therefore he usually forgot which page was up to and he always repeated a lot."
1843,"Besides, he was quite busy after the Umbrella Movement and I guess that's why he didn't have a thorough planning for his lectures."
1844,The first few lectures are quite easy to follow and with a lot of photos - but he used a lot of time to explain simple theories. The later lectures involved complicated theories and histories with lots of words in his ppt - but he needed to rush the syllabus - therefore there was not much time for us to digest.
1845,"Actually, there was only one plus side for his teaching, he had an extensive network and he could invite lots of guest speakers who had abundant knowledge about different issues too - and they taught better than Prof Sing.- just 1 MCQ exam at the end and 1 essay, lots of readings but no quizzes"
1846,- I really found out more about HK politics eg the way the constituents work so for me this course was successful
1847,- the readings were well chosen and interesting
1848,- the theory and content is very easy to grasp
1849,"- attendance not counted but exams based on lecture material as well as readings- Too lecture orientated, we literally just sat and listened for 1.5 hours (this is a problem with most UST courses), not much discussion a lot of watching/listening instead."
1850,- Difficult for non-chinese speakers (when I took this there were around 10 non-chinese taking the course) to keep up when the lecture stopped and videos were shown but it didn't affect my grade too much
1851,"- incorporation of guest speakers and guest events was good, we got to see other perspectives and voices regarding HK governance and it made the course more interestingMostly common sense things to local students."
1852,"Every week got 2 pieces of reading materials, they will only be tested on final exam.The teacher seemed to brainwash students by always revealing the dark side of governments. Other things are fine for me.Easy to get good result if you work hard 3 days before the exam even if you often skip lesson."
1853,"But you only got one chance, the final exam is heavily weighted.Nearly no workload."
1854,"Only a piece of essay at the end but it only counted 5%A rather comprehensive course about the whole Hong Kong political system. Talks about anything from Chief Executives to Legislative Council to the Umbrella Movement. Good for students eager to know more about the Hong Kong political mechanism.Not too good. Professor is biased. Although I personally agree with most of his views he does not provide a fair and impartial analysis of political events. Most of the time he is very anti-government and he voices it out openly. Curriculum planning is not done properly. Some materials are covered way too in depth while others are shallow. He also seems much more interested and involved in his work promoting his views in the society (newspaper columns, interviews, protests etc) than in teaching.Political affairs around HK. From Tung Chee-wah, Donald Tsang to CY Leung and Umbrella Movement.The prof is teaching quite good because he has profound knowledge about this aspect. But it seems he didn't have well planning about the course, i.e. teaching time is not equal for each topic.Very rich if you want to learn about the history & political background of Hong Kong. It gives you a thorough understanding of why Umbrella Movement happens, what happened during Tung Chee-wah, Donald Tsang, and CY Leung that caused Hong Kong people's dissatisfaction. Locals might have certain advantage as we would have heard of most of the event mentioned, but it is definitely worth for non-locals or mainland students to learn more about it if you want to know more about Hong Kong, particularly from a democratic standpoint."
1855,"There are 2 readings per week, but sometimes they will repeat what is taught in the lecture. If you want to learn more about democracy, change and Hong Kong, definitely read them and the optional reading, you will learn a lot.Prof Sing is a very prominent figure among democrats in Hong Kong and you will definitely learn a lot from him if you take his course. I would not deny his teaching is sometimes biased at some point, so you would need to think critically and independently, but he often back up his arguments with examples and clear logic flow.Structured content notes and topics are related to Liberal Studies in high school, so can relate concepts and examples learnt before. Also, most issues were happened in Hong Kong, that enhance the familarity of it.Good teaching with the use of relevant video clips that helps increase understanding of the topic.Very interesting. If you like Japan, you will learn a lot from culture to society. The course is mainly based on Hofstede's cultural values and by the end of the class, you will master these values. One more thing is about the movies played almost every class. Some of them are amazing but some are pretty hard to describe.Jerry is a good professor and he was always open to questions and very helpful.Using Hofstede Cultural Dimension Framework to analyze the political, economic, social, environmental and historical background of Japan."
1856,"In my view, the framework is not perfect for explaining some events/ development in Japan, and this is quite odd/ difficult for students to understand.Canadian NERD, voice is fxxking soft and cannot hear very clear."
1857,"Sometimes he may show movies in lectures, and these are very IMPORTANT for midterms and final!An interesting course for those who want to learn more about the legal system in PRC including various institutions and actors. The course pays attention to some of the major problems that the Chinese legal system faces. Last but not least, the content covers some of the means for social activism (protests, petitions etc...)The professor usually provides handouts, so there is no need to study from other sources (handouts are enough and generally are very well-structured). There are a lot of examples provided which are mainly about controversial cases happened before. There is not much interaction in class, as the professor is speaking most of the time, sometimes can be a bit monotonous but in general it is an interesting class. His stance towards the PRC government is relatively critical and some students may not like it.About the law and it's social,economic and political background during Chinese history.But the course focuses mainly on modern China. The prof gives many cases as examples in the class,however you don't need to remember most of the cases.Honestly speaking,the course is not as interesting as people imagine. The prof teaches as he's always reading the PPT and notes. Unluckily, it's quite difficult to find a clear logical order among the content he lists on the notes.quite interesting,"

There are a bunch of cases to be examined.Prof has a strong accent but it's not difficult to pick up. Prof provides us with detailed explanation on each cases and points. His whole teaching is literally based on the handouts which have included most of the points already. However, lessons are not interactive as Prof talks most of the time.As title, content mainly about some laws, courts and legal systems, quite interesting as it covers a lot of real-life cases.Not a great english speaker but talks fluently so you can understand without any difficulty. Not much interactions, so only listening and look at his slides and notes.WARNING: DO NOT CHOOSE THIS COURSE IF YOU ARE BAD AT RECITING!!!"
1870,China law and governance .... There are so much corruption and dark history. I am not too interested at reciting all of these.WARNING: DO NOT CHOOSE THIS COURSE IF YOU ARE BAD AT RECITING!!!
1871,"He is boring , just skip class and come back for pop up quiz (ask classmates when the quizzes are)The course was about the culture of Hong Kong in regards of Identity, Cityspace and Politics. If you are interested in local affairs and political active, you will be passionate to attend the lectures."
1872,"Topics included: Hong Kong-Chinese conflicts, Spacing, Hegemony, 1st July March, Umbrella Movement, etc.Professor will explain details about each topic and engage student's thinking (as it is a social science course). It's like listening to stories about the development of Hong Kong from the 1950s. Notes will be provided in each lectures."
1873,"The course is taught in spoken Cantonese and written English.The course is not about memorization, instead it leads u to understand basic sociology terms such as hegemony and apply them through writing essays(2 times for homework)and working on a group research project. My project title was political apathy which I find really thought-provoking when we relate our findings to the later umbrella movement... Quite a number of reading, it would be fine if you are interested in social issues and current news. Feel free to participate in in-class discussion in Cantonese!Professor is a respectful scholar, one of the best in hkust.The course is about Geographical Information System, which is a very useful system in many disciplines. There were only one lecture and one lab session per week. Prof. Ma taught the basic knowledge and applications of GIS in the lecture, while the TA taught the operation of the software in the lab session. The software they used was ArcGIS by Esri, which is a one of the most popular GIS software in the world.Prof. Ma is a nice person, but maybe not the best teacher. He did not include a lot of content, which I think most students would love to have such a lenient professor. However, the way he taught this course was a bit dull, and not many students in my class paid attention, some of them even skipped the lecture and only attended the lab session. Since the attendance was awful, Prof. Ma decided to delay the class for half an hour and started to take attendance. Even the class was not very interesting, I must say the professor did include some useful examples and he invited Prof. Quan (from the Department of CSE) to share his research, which helped the class to understand how can GIS apply on different disciplines.I'm only a year 1 SENG student who took DSE, never taken anything related to econ, or whatnot. Fairly easy in terms of learning the basic concepts to learn the GIS software. The lecture handles the concepts, and the Lab is the main part where you would learn how to use the software. Before taking the course, I thought it was just a random cc course, but I found that many companies make use of the GIS software, so not a total waste of time at all; I found it quite interesting to use too.You could tell he's quite passionate about teaching and sharing things related to the topic. But he tends to drag on with examples for too long and his speech can be quite dull too. Though he is very approachable to ask for help in the group project."
1874,"The TA is also very nice and I find that she teaches more useful content, mainly because we're actually learning about the software from her, and that actually using the software can also teach the concepts needed for the class, rather than just having the concepts being taught alone. She also can help you find some data if you're not too sure where to find them.Overall, it was an average course. Very macroecononomics concentrated.  The assignments were very much similar to the examples provided on the textbook.She was a detailed teacher. Prompt to answer questions via email. The test material was more from the ppt slides, then from the textbook.The course is about China-US relations, so it covers some Chinese history and several current affairs between US and China, for instance human rights, economic aspect, Taiwan relation etc.Barry's teaching is interesting, as he will teach the content with a more casual way, instead of just telling all content in ppt. He will include lots of extra information as well as his experience in researching about China foreign relation, so you won't be bored in class. Also his teaching pace is appropriate, as he will pause a little whenever he finishes a small part.A brief introduction about the relationship of China and US, in terms of economic, history and issue likes Tibet and human right."
1875,"The powerpoint provided not much useful in term of exam, it can only tell you which option is wrong.Most of the time just read what is on his notes which is a bit boring, but love to answer student question.Midterm: History of China from the Sino-Western connection, safety problem(nuclear weapons), econ relationships"

As it is a relatively small class, atmosphere of learning environment it very good.introductory sociology course. covers gender issues, religion, family, and other fundamentals with specific focus on hong kong society, so contents are extremely applicable. the textbook is a very good resource.I sing praise about this course and SOSC 2740 (Groves' most advanced undergrad course, in terms of course number). He's a brill lecturer. Shines in huge LT lectures. He provides sound insight into fundamentals of Sociology, and is easily one of (if not the) most interactive lecturer I've yet had.

As usual, common core content is quite easy, but the readings are a lot a lot a lot, get prepared.The professor is simply reading the powerpoint with a monotone.

2040,"Absolute grading, so students can easily track which grade they can get or set target for themselves"
2041,"Professor did not take attendance but there are in total 5 short quiz during lectures, which provide chance to earn extra credits.

2067,"boring, monotone, sound quite soft :(boring content, very broad but no concrete and useful content for my future studieshea professor, no passion at all, i studied this course obviously because its compulsory to GCS students. She only talks in one tone,although the exam was really hard for me, i still managed to get a B for my final grade, i don't know why, maybe because everyone did poorly.Workload is fine, as i remember, one midterm and one final and also one group project. Selecting good group mates are very important for this course."
2068,"There are a lot of readings but the professor is going to announce which pages of the textbook is important for the exams JUST one week before the exam, LOL better ask friends who have studied this course for it.The content emphasise more on economic globalization for those who hv rich background will be benefitedShe is really hea always looking at the clock as if she really wants to end the lesson early."
2069,I think is ok to skip lessons as what she talks is just inside the power point
2070,"Also she played loads of videos to fill the lesson time (so she didn't have to teach) and she left the classroom when it was playing (I don't think people will play full attention to watch many of them leave early )The course is about globalization of economy, politics, society and so on(covered many aspects but prof only taught a bit of each topics in the class, students needed to read many contents in the required/optional readings.)Prof is from Korea but I think her teaching maybe a bit boring.."
2071,and her PPT is in the form of filling in the blanks.The first midterm is quite difficult while the second one is reasonable if you have memorize her slides. The project is very important as it occupies the largest percentage. Grading is relatively fine but don't expect to have great teaching.Her teaching is relatively bad. Always have break time and does not engage students during her lesson. Not much content delivered and does not give feedback to student's response.Course outline:
2072,-What is globalization? Is globalization a new phenomenon?
2073,-How do we explain globalization?
2074,-International trade and production

2080,"-China in the globalized world and the future of globalizationProf. Cho is a crazily hea lecturer, expect many videos on lecture which you can find youtube, weeks of project consultation and presentation. Fill in the blanks for lecture notes. There will also be a break in the middle of lecture, but she can still finish the lecture 10 min earlier. Not much feedback for students' answer on lecture.three main areas:"
2081,economic globalization (for 7 weeks)
2082,"politics, e.g. terrorism"
2083,"how far did China globalize?I appreciate her being frank during class. She is not a professor urging people answering questions. However, her ppt is her own highlight of the reading material. Reading material is extremely important."
2084,"She did not address our concerns well, she always nodded, but I didn't know what she wanted to tell us.the content is not very useful at all"
2085,"it talks too much about the ancient globalization, which no one ever cares and they are not important"
2086,"I prefer to talk more about modern society then the ancient oneprof cho, although pretty, speaks very softly."
2087,no one could ever hear what she is saying
2088,"also, she seems a bit 'hea', playing useless videos all the time instead of teachingMost of the content covered in this course is relatively straight-forward, which is a good thing, because it ensures that people come in to class with some sort of idea about what is happening. The course covers very relevant concepts in international economics and politics, looking at the failures of geopolitical organizations and geo-economic organizations.Very structured course and teaching, in terms of following the syllabus and staying with the content. Course is designed with the aim of real world applicability, and hence there are lots of videos/movies shown in class.There is a reading material you would have to read. Its not much, but you should start reading at least before your midterm. The readings will help your exams."
2089,"Her exams are comparatively easily to other courses, somewhat confusing at the same time, but still decent."
2090,"The content itself is quite easy to understand.Prof. Cho's teaching is decent. She prepares powerpoints for students, but there are fill in the blanks, meaning you would have to attend the classes. She speaks fluent english and tries to engage with students.Provide fundamental knowledge of the ideas and the concepts of the three fathers of the Sociology - Marx, Durkheim and Weber. You will learn more how their theories can explain the socio-economical events nowadays and in the past. There are many contradictions between these three, however there are many similarities.A lot of examples from nowadays making it easier to understand the concepts. The teacher is very objective and he tries to cover as many points of view as possible. Professor So himself have US education background but he is also very ""local"" which may create better communication between him and the rest of the students. You can ask questions during the lectures but try not to ask too much. TA was not competent. No group project, nor presentations.Provide an in-depth view into giant socialists: Marx, Durkheim, Parson and more. Ppts are well-written and comprehensible, relative to the original works of the socialists which are extremely difficult to understand.A funny and experienced professor who is capable of putting theories into practice in class to make them comprehensible. And professor welcomes questions and we always have mini discussions in class, in which we students engage to put the theories into applications, too :) So, the classes are highly interactive.The course will teach you different approaches for understanding personality. You will spend more time learning about the psychoanalytic (extremely odd but interesting, especially if you like penises) and trait approaches, which will be tested on the midterm. The behavioral, humanistic, cognitive, and biological approaches are tested on the final."
2091,"The content is great in the sense that it provides insight into and allows you to think about your own and others' personalities through many different perspectives, including but not limited to childhood, behavior, culture, etc.If Michelle tells the students about the heavy workload in the first lecture and suggests the students to drop, don't. I think she just wants a smaller class."
2092,"Michelle was able to make the class interesting and engages with all her students, especially ones that show up late (for bants). Her teaching style makes it very easy to follow. She also gives out free lecture notes during class.Learning personality through the six approaches."
2093,"Psychoanalytic, trait, behavioural, cognitive, biological and humanistic approaches are covered, she has a final wrap up for the integration (though it was a really quick and short one)Michelle is a funny instructor, although she set guidelines in the first class and then 1/3 of the class dropped out (perhaps people are scared by her). She treated the class as a 'mom style'. She cared about each student. Her funny and interactive way of teaching made the 3 hour class cool. She included many experience in the class so the pace of teaching is quite slow. And in the last week of course, she lagged behind the syllabus and became much more efficient in terms in teaching which seems better to us."
2094,"She included a personality test at the beginning of the course so we can understand ourself better.The content covered was very interesting. It covers personality as defined by the trait, humanistic, cognitive, psychoanalytic, behavioural and biological approaches. Relevant research was discussed.Excellent. Michelle is one of the best professors I have had in UST. There were active class discussions. She asked us to submit a query sheet after every chapter. This helped us understand each topic better. One need not worry about lecture slides as she prints it out for the students."
2095,"Even though the class is three hours, one would not feel bored. If you're an international student, be prepared for Michelle to ask you many questions during the lecture.It cover almost all social science discipline"
2096,"Including psychology, economy, political science, public policy, demography and other disciplines."
2097,"It will be a interesting course if you like social science, and can provide you a brief and wide understanding of each social science discipline.As Cameron is the coordinator of this course, he will appear in this course every time, but all he does is just take attendance. So you better not skip your lesson as he can memorize who have enrolled in this lesson."
2098,"Every lesson will be featured with different guest lecturer, mostly from HKUST, but some of them are from other university as well, and they will talk about different social science discipline by talking about their research or briefly talk about the course content that they are teaching."
2099,"Although there are some boring lecturer, most of them are interesting and able to bring some new insights to me."
2100,"Also, because all of them use english as teaching medium, if you are not good at english you will find it quite difficult to follow (eg me)It covers everything."
2101,"The course can be divided into 2 parts. The first is the videos. You are required to watch them online. In the video, you can see how Cameron do the presentation... I'm just kidding. The video mainly focuses on introducing basic knowledge of social science research."
2102,The second part is the lecture. Different instructors with different research interests are invited to the class. Case analysis is the most interesting part of the lecture.Cameron is nice and patient. He served as a guide in this semester for QSA students.
2103,"As for other instructors, once you concentrate on their research, you will never find this course boring.Different professors will come and share, which is quite fun in my view. All professors talk about social science topics like sociology or psychology and stuffs like that.Cameron don't teach much directly since it is basically sharing of many guests but the flow of the class is alright."
2104,"It is fun that professor gave us links of his online courses and told us to watch them, yet it is pretty much unrelated with the exam or whatsoever, and that most of the students just dont watch them at all. LOLThis course is quite interesting as we had a lot of guests thoughtout the semester who came to present their research and discuss with us important topics that can usually be linked to current events. It's a highly interactive course.Unfortunately, as most of our lectures were lead by the guests, we didn't really have the opportunity to learn many things from our professor directly. He has more of a passive role in this course, as he makes sure many guests will attend the course, but doesn't teach directly the course's contentFormal education analyzed in sociological terms, inequalities, ethnic minorities, etc. Its range is quite broad: e.g. debates in education at all levels from Hong Kong to across different countries. With a broad but in-depth analysis, it makes you learn quite a lot in this course.Dr. Groves encourages discussions and student participations in class. The more you take part in, the more credit can be obtained towards counting the final grade. But this requires quite an effort to catch up with the class, by reading the weekly assignments frequently and thoroughly, for example. You can hardly catch up with the class nor even learn a thing in class if you do not study the weekly reading assignments or revise the materials taught in the lecture."
2105,"But Groves' teaching is quite interesting in a sense that he tells some jokes in class to draw your attention and plays some videos on Youtube. This is at least more interesting than those mundane ""non-interacting"" lectures.Content is good, the lesson talks about the relationship between education and different aspect of society such as gender, racing, social class and ethnicity.The PPT is quite attractive as it's in point form and sometimes there are short videos, so do long the one. If you are not good in English, it might be tight to you to look at the long video. However, it's fine that even your English is not very native.If you are interested in learning education -related materials, you will definitely love this course."
2106,Themes include:
2107,1. Labeling Effects
2108,2. Education and Social Class
2109,3. Education and Gender
2110,4. Hong Kong Education
2111,5. Issues in Higher Education
2112,6. Progressive Education
2113,"All of them are quite interesting, and there are readings/ videos/ ppt slides about the theme.Interactive teaching, and the slides are well-prepared as well."
2114,Good classroom management and students love to discuss with him after class.
2115,Strong British accent which may be a bit hard for some local students to catch up.
2116,"A little break of 5~10 minutes is given in each class, which could let students to rest."
2117,"No computer/ mobile device could be used in the lecture, may be quite harsh to some students.Before midterm: More about sociological concepts like correspondence principle, labeling theory, hidden curriculum"
2118,"After midterm: Applying sociological concepts into current education system, ranging from HK higher education system to the Finnish system. To be exact, I would just quote some guided questions in the syllabus that I received at the first class."
2119,"The course will initiate a sociologically informed conversation about education.What is school for?What social forces have shaped our current educational practices? Does schooling provide new opportunities, or perpetuate old inequalities? How are ethnic minorities marginalized from education systems? Why do boys perform so poorly compared to girls in our schools? What should be the role of the humanities and creativity in education? Why is there a ¡°crisis¡± in higher education?How might education be reformed?To answer these questions, we will study a number of important sociological works on education and you will be encouraged to reflect upon your own educational experiences, as well as examine contemporary debates about education at all levels in Hong Kong, and across cultures.His teaching is quite good and he is very willing to help any students who cannot follow. It is worth-mentioning that there will be additional office hours just before the midterm and final exam. He will give some hints about the content of the exam, so do take advantage of that. Do try that even if you are good enough as it certainly will boost your score.A lot of analyzing of social trends in education, the formation of out modern education system and its flaws, and some interesting theories about the subject. A lot of words, no math, and the topics are honestly very interesting and make you think about your society on a deeper level.The content is very interesting and he encourages discussion and interaction. However, if you are not seriously well versed in English, you will have a tough time, as he uses specialist terms fairly often and you need to understand the context well to make sense of it all. He is also very helpful in office hours and will give hints about the exams, so take advantage of that!If you are really interested in knowing more about china's environmental policies, related figures and the governance part,you should take this course as it provides you with a very comprehensive content.Unfavourable accent,wooden word-by-word teaching,terrible tutorial for the projects,random iprs and group discussion in lectures to check your attendance,"
2120,"but she is quite willing to answer your questions and I can tell she is really care about the environment of China from her action.not so good gradeBasically about the energy governance in China, which covers mainly about the pollution problems in China and how to cope with the issues with different policies.Lectures were quite dull, as she was just reading out most of the slides with a tiny bit of elaboration. Besides, the instructor's pronunciation may be difficult to understand, although she tried her best to make everyone attentive.Environmental and Energy Governance in China."
2121,"More likely the policies and current projects, etc.The pronunciation may be hard to understand, but the professor tries her best to make everyone attended.You can get good grades in mid term and final, if you recite all the details in the powerpoint, which consists of around 40 pages per file.There are two projects, which require the distributions of surveys and group interpretation of the datas, but questionnaires should not be done in hkust, instead, 4 different age groups, 4 different individual income groups, 4 different household income groups, 4 different education levels, and 1 car owner should be involved in 6 survey samples.Topics covered in this course: Research Methods, Memory, Learning, Development, Sensation and Perception, States of Consciousness, Intelligence, Personality, Social Psychology, Psychological Disorders, Treatment of Psychological Disorders and Health & Well-being. Most of the PowerPoints are short (about 20-40 pages each) and consist of key concepts only which are easy to understand. Some of the contents are quite interesting, such as the experiments, for example, the Bobo Doll experiment, that were carried out to investigate certain theories related to psychology.The instructor teaches in a fun way, she is very nice and always smiles when she talks and tries to make the atmosphere very relaxing. You won't fall asleep easily in this class. Also, there are musical warmups in the first 5 minutes of class, a small break halfway through the lecture, and often video clips about some experiments or studies will be shown. Sometimes she will ask students questions about their opinions/thoughts on a topic, and she will give interesting responses.Content is easy."
2122,"Research methods, learning, memory, dream, sensation and perception, development, social psychology, health psychology, psychological disorder, etc.."
2123,"If you are interested in psychology, it is not a big deal."

2130,"Sexy voice. Clear accent.Everyone has been saying that this is a good course. As a newbie who heard the rumour and benefits of this common core course, my friends and I enrolled in this course together in summer."
2131,The content is pretty interesting and simple ideas are presented to guys with no psychology background.
2132,"Topics: Sleep, Hypnotization, Growth, Memory, Learning, Personality and psychology in social perspectives.The young and smart professor spoke in fluent English and didn't give us a headache. You may need to fill in some blanks in the powerpoints during lectures. But she taught the topics in an interesting manner so that you wouldn't easily fall asleep."
2133,\
2134,"However, there are no tutorials so that you don't know how to complete the assignments that fit their judging criteria. Not until the last moment would you know how did you do wrong. Nonetheless, no corrections are available, resulting in low marks.A well designed course that provides an introduction to non-social science students.I think the prof is well prepared for the teaching. There are interactive activities, videos and examples to illustrate different conceptsI was above mean and I got a B range. I think the grading of the course is not as good as what people usually describe,There are only 2 assignments and 2 quizzes, but adequate time should be put in order to catch up and perform well. Having said that, the work load is still very well manageable even taking it in the summer semesterA good basic course for psychology learning, good for those interested in psychology."
2135,400 student lecture in LTA. 9 am class.
2136,The instructor is so kind that she allowed students to bring breakfast to lecture. However I thought that should be a bread or sandwich instead of something smells so strong that would disturb more than 20 people around you. I really hated those who brought take-away breakfast from Cafe to the lecture.Very clear teaching and soft voice. She is very nice.
2137,"But points in lecture notes are kind of different from that chapter in textbook. It feels like the lecture notes are focusing on part of that textbook chapter and explaining in details. It caused a heavier workload when you have to deal with both and some confusions when you go through them.Topic covered include research methods, memory, learning, sensation and perception, state of consciousness, intelligence, development, personality, social psychology, health psychology and psychological disorder. About 60 pages of notes per topic. Most of the topics are interesting and easy to understand. It gives you insight about what psychology is. Videos about some experiment are also shown during lecture.Its a 3 hours lecture starting at 9 am and 3 lectures per week. It may be difficult for some people to wake up that early during summer but i say worth it. I sit at the front rows. maybe that helped me concentrate and prevented me from sleeping."
2138,"Instructor speaks clearly and always try to interact with the class. There's a 15 minutes break midway through the class. You can go to toilet, buy some food or drink, take a nap or ask her questions. She is more than willing to answer any questions. You are also required to read some chapters from the textbook after each lecture. You can borrow the textbook from HKUST library or public library.The text book is called Understanding Psychology.  The notes are well prepared and summarized, which makes it very easy to understand the general schemes of this course. Personally speaking, I like to study the ideas related to psychology so I find the materials interesting.The instructor expresses every concept in the notes clearly and vividly. Each concept is followed by either examples or video clips. Although in summer term the course length was three hours, I didn't feel tired or skip a single class.Topics include: psychological research, neuroscience and behaviour, sensation and perception, stats of consciousness(e.g sleep and dream), learning process, memory, cognition and language, intelligence, development, personality, health psychology and psychological disorders."
2139,"(Don't be afraid of so many topics. Each topic just consists of one powerpoint slide, which is around 50-60 pages only and they just focus on the virtual side of these topics)"
2140,"I think this course is great to everybody. Through this course, you can better understand yourself and others and the rationale behind their behaviour.Professor lai is a very nice guys and her teaching would force you to be more attentive to her lessons. So don't skip them. The powerpoint slides are clear and concise. However, jotting notes is necessary as you won't understand some of the concepts if you don't attend the lessons.The content is quite interesting and easy to understand."
2141,It covers something like human sleeping cycle to illusion.
2142,"Pay attention in class and you can remember most of the content for quiz.Prof Lai is a adorable tutor who makes you want to pay attention in lecture. She is sometimes funny and knows how to keep the pace of lecture.the content is funny and interesting , many real life example make student easy to understand and memorize .Good teaching , have interaction with students .

2238,"13.  Psychological Disorders Ch. 15 & 16Beatrice speaks fluent and clear English, extremely local friendly. She can explain the concepts very clear and with the aid of real life examples. Videos will be played to facilitate learning and it's somewhat relaxing during a 3 hour lecture (there is a 15 min break in between, super considerate lecturer <3 ). Nevertheless, I just don't find myself focus in class. It's just a bit boring...I found it boring. Pretty sure it's my own problem though. The topics are OK and cover most parts of daily life. If you are genuinely interested in psychology definitely go for it.Clear voice. Teaching is not very interesting despite the in-class activities included.The content mainly covers basic psychological concepts and other topics including memory, learning and psychological disorders.She is a really good instructor who is very engaging and interactive throughout the class. Definitely should take her class.The grading seems fair. Even though the average is really high, as long as you read the lecture notes well and prepare for the exams properly, you should land with an A range.It is a light course which becomes demanding only during exams if that is the kind of student you are.quite interesting and it is not too difficultthe professor is quite kind and she is willing to answer students' questions"

There are 12 chapters of the course and each chapter is not too long. You can review the content easily and effectively. Reading the text book is required and some of the questions in the exam are about the content in the text book.I can say Lai Pui Yee is one of the best instructor I even seen in HKUST. Her tone and voice will not makes you sleepy and her teaching is clear that makes you understand the content easily. There are many fun interactions in the lesson like memory test that make you don't  feel boring in the class.Content are varies from Psychology and it highly relies on the recommended reading.
2252,the content is not boring but didnt need any thinking.Her voice is extremely soft and easily fall asleep since the course is held on 9:00 am.

2412,Topics taught with 1 lecture
2413,Topics taught with 2 lectures
2414,The content was quite interesting. It covered topics which are pretty useful in our daily lives.
2415,The lecture ppts are very well made. They highlight a few important concepts in each slide and they are always shown in a very neat manner.Eva talks in a very playful way. She has a good grasp of English and always manages to make the atmosphere very relaxing.I like the content. Quite easy to understand even i have no prior knowledge about psychologyfluent english and american accent makes the teaching so much understandable and easy to follownot bad but not as good as other people rated
2416,"I believe people who take notes in classroom is betterreally not much comparing to other courses just assignments that you can receive opinion from the TA, who is very nice. The first one I received low grades but for the second one i achieved much highera brief teaching in all the the china envr problems and how china deal with it. Just a brief~learn a lot of China envr policies and the current china envr problem."
2417,"She encourage class interaction! Nice prof!The content is very similar to SOSC1170 as mentioned  by other reviewers. Not difficult at all. Interesting topics. Professor welcomes discussions.The teaching was not perfect, but still acceptable."
2418,"Professor explained concepts clearly and encouraged discussions among students.Grading is very good for a SOSC4K-level course. Active class participation and discussion is the key to success. You will need to show a strong interest in topics discussed and give constructive comments. Also, you teammates play an important role as some work has to be done in a group.Acceptable. You efforts paid off. Good luck!First of all, the content of the course is very similar to the content of the prerequisite course SOSC 1170. To be honest, I could only spot some few differences comparing the two courses' content. What really differs from the previous course was the articles required for us to read and review, as well as the personal research paper.Teaching was average, content delivery was clear but not super interesting. I wish there are more guidance for the final research work.starting with basic stuff, like mean, mode, median, standard deviation and normal distribution."
2419,"After the mid term, the course focus on statistical inference, t-test, confident interval, etc."
2420,"Iprs at the beginning of every lesson.the professor is quite clear. After a few chapters, we will have a review in class, so many students can follow."
2421,"but sometimes you may find mistakes on his supplementary exercises, don't be surprised.It might seems easy at first, as the topics are covered in high school math (mean mode median, sd, probit, etc). However, new topics will be introduced after midterm, and there are many new terms. So don't be fooled by the topics at first.Quite unorganised ppt, it takes some time for you to adapt to his style (always uh uh uh...)"
2422,But he will distribute question bank practice question before midterm and final.This course mainly introduces you to some basic concepts about statistics. There was demonstration for Excel in the lessons as well.The teaching of instructor was fair but not very interesting.The grading of this course is quite good. The two assignments added up to a total of about 10% which do make a difference because most of the people got high marks.There are two assignments in total for this course. The workload is quite low and there are only MC questions in the mid-term examination. There are both MC and long questions in final exam which involves some simple calculation.Just a basic statistics
2423,not very useful
2424,just a little bit math
2425,"some skills about excel , quite useful"
2426,Have attendance (every lesson)not good / boring
2427,most of the student come to the class for attendence only
2428,you can read the notes by yourself
2429,"and there is lecture video for the computer sessionReally straight forward in the beginning (mean mode median, sd and curve area.) IB Math SL covers the stuff. But you need to learn how to use the different tables. After midterm if your not focused, everything is like alien language. Before the midterms you can slack off but after you really need to pay full attention.Presentation didn't feel that organised to me. Started getting really confused. Strongly suggest using the textbook he said. During midterms and finals revision resources are given out."
2430,"If you have any questions, Professor Wang is very open to you finding him. It was pretty helpful. I suggest preparing some specific questionsSimple statistics from high school, such as z-test, t-test and simple regression line."
2431,"The iprs session starts sharply in the beginning of the lecture. So, be quick. After the PRS session, it's up to you to whether sleep or leave the class.It's okay..at first we learn easy things mean mode median, but midterm include not so many maths. Instead, social research concept is include."
2432,"But final have many maths, people cannot catch upsome said professor speach are 1999"
2433,but I think it is ok . A lot of illustration is added
2434,"but powerpoint is quite clear that you can skip lecturesThe content is rather realistic and easy, which includes the basic statistics and calculation, for instance sd, t-test, P-value and sampling distribution. The content delivered in the lecture is rather realistic and practical. For me, it provides tools for me to analyze the data of midterm and final results released in other courses.The lecturer is very kind to help students and he lays great stress on the concept, which is conducive to our learning.Basic knowledge in statistics, starting with DSE F6 core statistics, then M1 syllabus, at last with hypothesis testing."
2435,Simple linear regression is not covered in the semester as time is not enough.
2436,"Statistic is important for all the streams in UST, pay attention to the exclusions.Prof. Wang followed the powerpoint to teach(with quite a number of it skipped and will not be covered in exam). He didn't speak in a really fluent way, but still able to understand."
2437,"You may ask him after class, he will be very patient listening to you, and explain clearly (sometimes is needed). You may ask him in putonghua."
2438,"You may Send him an email for questions also, he replied quickly and clearly.content is general. To start with S6 Math Core Statistics part. Then Probability and so on. Not too difficult, but require huge efforts to understand new terms. In later times, e.g. binomial probability: study of proofs is needed. If you are not familiar with studying proofs, you could still give it a go. Because the proof is not too difficult.Do more proof in later part, i.e. binomial probability, inference"
2439,"TA (Bill) Did not answer your own question in a direct way, esp Homeworkit'll will be much better if you have interest in humanities subjects such as geography, history etc cuz it requires quite A LOT OF MEMORISATION. it will also be an advantage if you have an economic background (tho the math is quite easy to catch up)"
2440,The course talks about the poverty situation all over the world (it does not focus only in a certain region) so I find it quite interesting.
2441,The course teaches you:
2442,- how to analyse poverty with different statistical methods.
2443,- WHY are some countries wealthier and poorer than others in multiple aspects
2444,"- Then talks a bit about what are the solutions of povertytbh the professor is quite boring. She is a mainland professor but her accent is quite easy to understand, she also tries to be interactive but cuz the class is in LTD most ppl ignore her.  I don't skip classes but it's quite hard to concentrate as she mainly reads the powerpoint."
2445,However you have to go to class as she leaves blanks in the powerpoint slides! Sometimes she has pop-up attendance checking and asks you to complete a simple task or calculation and hand it to the TA. ( a part of class participation)
2446,"The videos she chooses are quite entertaining and related to the course, you can take some time to watch them during your study (links in the ppt)1. Why study poverty? A bird view of the course"
2447,2. Defining and Measuring Poverty
2448,3-4. Inequality and Social Exclusion
2449,1) Inequality: Lorenze Curve (Gini Coefficient)
2450,2) Dimensions of Inequality and Social Exclusion

2454,Part Four Fighting Poverty
2455,8. Welfare Policy Design
2456,9-10. Aid and Public Infrastructure Support
2457,11-12. Credit and Financial Institutions
2458,"As suggested by the topics, some economic concepts like Gini coefficient are involved, and some very simple calculations are needed in exam."
2459,"But overall the course is interesting for people who are concerned about global and HK poverty issue.Dr. Wang is really nice and very passionate about teaching. She tried her best to interact with students and assigned simple group work in lecture.The content includes quite a lot of items, e.g. the reasons, impacts and the solutions of poverty and that examples from a lot of countries will be given to support the views."
2460,The content taught before the mid term is each easier.The professor simply read from the ppt. (btw the content of the ppt is quite easy to understand) But she would ask some questions during the class to maintain interaction and would play some videos to make the lessons funnier.
2461,"She is very nice that she would answer your questions after class patiently and that she would ask question to create interaction in classes.Content is easy.  Although I am just a year 1, the content is not difficult at all.  Just some basic graphs, analyzing the trends of the poverty situation of some countries and some measures to fight poverty.  You are required to remember some facts about the poverty situation.  However mid term and final will not ask those facts in a very detailed way.  Maybe 1 or 2 MC questions asking those facts.  No worry if you did not study that part!!!!!!Professor Wang tried to create a more interesting teaching atmosphere.  She requires us to have some kind of discussions with our group members during class.  However, due to the content of this course, it is very difficult to have an interesting learning atmosphere.  She explained the graphs and trends clearly in class.  Overall acceptable teaching.Defining and Measuring Poverty"

2469,"The topics would be easier to be handled for students who are from humanities or business. As a science student, sometimes it is interesting yet sometimes it is difficult to understand and have to try a bit harder to catch up.The professor is active and knows very well on how to draw your attention. She encourages students to think more than telling us the facts from the slides. Sometimes there are only some questions on the slide so we have to think and then answer them on our own. Although she might not know every student, she tried her best to get to know you so her lessons were quite fun.Content is fun, you don't get bored in class, although a lot of it are knowledge you already know, but once in a while lectures do surprise you.The professor is enthusiastic and knowledgeable, knows how to attract your attention and teach.A lot of exchange students and senior year students took this course in the semester, so wasn't exactly easy to get good grades.One mid-term, one final, one assignment, and one project. Quite easy, exams are MC and short questions, just chillin there.- very straight forward"
2470,- common sense
2471,"- simpleShe's knowledgeable and passionate but from time to time, it might get boring since the contents are not so complex.fair"
2472,- one homework submitted through canvas which takes around 15-20 minutes
2473,"- group project, research paper (6 people in a group), you can choose the group mates (no presentation)"
2474,- midterm (multiple choice and calculation)
2475,"- final (multiple choice and calculation)one group project that is acceptable unless you have a free rider, but there is peer evaluation."
2476,"in preparation for midterm and final, only need to read ppt, no need to memorise word by word since the questions are multiple choice.Very boring course as the content is really simple"
2477,There is reading material but it is not necessary to read them
2478,"This course aims to make students gain familiarity with poverty issues including poverty measurement, underlying causes of poverty, the impact of poverty on society and government programs and policies that address poverty. We will illustrate principles with real-world applications. Though the course discusses poverty in a broad context of developing and developed countries, an extra emphasis will be put on poverty related issues in Hong Kong and mainland China.Just read out the content on the slides"
2479,"Boring and often starts late and ends earlyThe first half of the course is about the concept of poverty; how to measure poverty; gender, ethnic and age inequality. The later half is about the cause of poverty from the perspective of geography, culture and institutions and the focus is how to fight poverty."
2480,"Easy to understand and can raise your interest if you haven't taken any sosc course.The professor has been teaching the course continually for several semesters, so the teaching is quite skillfully. You can find every sentence the professor says on the slides, which largely reduces the burden of revision during the exam period. She talks quite slow and keeps putting forward encouraging questions, helping us to have a better understanding of the situation of the poor by considering ourselves living the life of the poor.The Content is very very easy and general. You can understand all of the questions easily."
2481,"All of the contents are just like LS ,geog with simple calculations. You can study 2-3days before the exam and still can get a satisfactory mark.~The Teaching is fine. She will ask many questions to students and provide a lot of supplementary video for us. Since the content is easy, I do think teaching doesnt make huge differenceMostly about poverty before mid term, and policy analysing after mid term, all of them are easily understanding.Good instructor with prominate language skills, strong interaction between teacher and students.10% Class Participation: Presence in the lecture will benefit the students greatly in understanding related topics. Some lectures involve interactive game, group discussion and video session. For those activities, students will be randomly selected to share your opinion."
2482,30% Two Problem Sets:
2483,-5% Individual assignment
2484,-25% Group project: Each group (composed of 6 people) is to submit a regional poverty analysis (week 13).
2485,30% Midterm Exam
2486,"30% Final ExamMid term and final exam are easy and the heaviest workload comes from the group project.Poverty is the main concept in this course. You don't have to be familiar with the situation in Hong Kong since lecture notes cover examples from all over the world. If you are interested in studying poverty, it is a great basic course.Although there are many words on the lecture notes, it may be slightly difficult to understand the concepts or meaning behind. I think Prof. Wang did some explanation in class to help you think and understand. For those who don't like to do revision, attending the lecture and listening to professor can help! Just try not to fall asleep in class because you may skip some fill in the blank in the notes.The course starts from the basics of poverty, such as Gini coefficient, lorentz curve, parade of dwarfs, absolute and relative concepts of poverty in different areas, economic lives of the poor, and dimensions of poverty and inequality."
2487,"Above are materials from before the midterm. They will not be tested in the finals. Below are materials after the midterm, which are tested in the final exam."
2488,"Different causes of poverty, institutional and economical reasons, historical reasons (like european colonization), and different ways to tackle poverty, welfare, education, health and finance.I think Wang Jin's teaching is OK. She will try her best to have more interactions. But she just reads ppt directly most of the times. She will also give guidance to us on how to do our projects.Week 1: Introduction; Technology, Power, and the Foundations of the Industrial Workplace"

2517,"Watson, Tony J. 2008. Sociology, Work and Industry. 5th ed. New York: Routledge."
2518,"Boreham, Paul. 2008. New Technology @ Work. New York: Routledge."
2519,"A small number of short readings may be distributed in class. (Usually for the group report, but those will not be examined)"
2520,NO TEXTBOOK THAT STUDENTS NEED TO BUY.
2521,The average amount of reading is 20 pages per weekNaubahar is a passionate and patient teacher who is willing to answer students anytime through email.
2522,The class is not boring as Naubahar is a quite interesting professor.
2523,"Videos will be played sometimes.Interesting content, talks about the history and the interaction between science, technology and workHe's the best professor I've ever seen in UST, good interaction and explanations are clear, his lessons are very interesting.Midterm - 30%"
2524,Final - 35%
2525,PRS - 15% (only around half is counted)
2526,5 group report - 20% (best 4 is counted)
2527,"As the content of the course is mostly common sense, the average score of the class is quite high, which is around 80%, both mid-term and final cover MCQ and short question, which is quite easy, the major difference is score would be on short question, all you need to do is to pay attention in class and memorize what he said."
2528,Grading is pretty fair
2529,86-100 A range
2530,80-85.99 B range
2531,"Below 80(79.99 onwards) C rangeOnly PRS, Mid term, Final and group discussion in class, which the reading materials for the discussion will be provided in class, so the workload is not that high, just remember to take the PRS as this 15% is super important to your final grade, the average score is around 80%, so never skip lessons :)The content is quite interesting and somehow related to everyday lives. However, some topics are hard for me since the ppt covers many aspects.The professor is good and funny. He teaches well in a lively way. He repeats all the important notes in every lesson and provides pre-exam notes.I only got a C+ at last. Attendance, midterm, final and discussions all count into the course grade.There are PRS questions, one midterm and one final examination. Also, there are 5 group discussion exercises, only 4 of the best ones will count into the course grade.This course explains how science, technology and work are interacted with each other before, during and after industrial revolution. Studying the causes and effects of industrial revolution, the content is kinda like common sense.The professor is very nice. He teaches patiently and gives a lot of examples on each topics. He usually asks us questions to let us think more. Most of the questions he will provide answers and sometimes the question is related to the group project. He always explains the topic of group report clearly and makes sure all of us understand it before he start.This course is about studying the interactions between Science, Technology and Work before the Industrial Revolution to nowadays economy. You can see there is changes in the society and work through out the time, it is pretty interesting.The professor's teaching is quite good, actually, he is the best professor I have ever seen so far. He explains the concepts pretty well and supplement with a few examples to help you to understand. He will do PRS to check your understanding.It talks about how the science and technology changed our workplace and society in the past few decades.The Professor is very nice and welcome to any feedback!Grading is quite good!"
2532,The course has four major components:
2533,1 Midterm 30%
2534,2 Final 35%
2535,3 PRS 15% (Best 15 out of 17/ while the 17 are selected from a pool of 20 by the professor)
2536,4 Group Discussion 20% (Best 4 out of 5)
2537,Grade Distribution
2538,A 15%
2539,B 40%
2540,C 35-40%
2541,D 5%
2542,F Remainder
2543,I got a B+ eventually
2544,Midterm: mean
2545,Final: +0.6 SD
2546,PRS: Full mark
2547,Discussion: Mostly above mean (8.5-9/10)You have to go class even though he won't take attendance.
2548,The professor will take PRS at any time. (Mostly at the beginning of each lesson). You will score 10 points for the correct answer but 4 points for the incorrect answer. (So answering wrongly is still better than answering nothing)
2549,"There will be 5 group works throughout the semester, which is to write a short essay for 1-2 pages. It has to be done during the lesson so you don't have any group work to do at home."
2550,"Other than that, the workload is not heavy at all since I didn't do any readings. Memorizing all the powerpoint slides the night before exam is enough to attain at least B range.The course serves as a good introduction to the relationship between science, technology and the workplace, and the growth of economies from the era of the industrial revolution to today. The lecture slides are concise and contain all the relevant information in an easy to read format. Most of the readings are also very interesting, albeit rather long. At the end of the course the professor provided reading summaries so that wasn't too much of a problem.I was never really interested in the social sciences, but the professor managed to keep me engrossed in all of his lectures. His analysis and lectures are in depth but easy to understand. He encourages questions in class and answers them all very well. He also makes sure he entertains all the student feedback that he can.Content is interesting, it gives a lot of insight to the history of the merging of science, technology and work. The lecture includes a lot of videos as well, though it is not included in the mid-term and final exams. The contentThe professor is great. clear explanations, well thought out answers in response to students questions, interesting teaching and his tone won't make you fall asleepContent is slightly lengthy, although you get to learn quite a lot about how society has changed through the past few centuries in terms of science technology and work environment. You get to learn some interesting features about how different parts of the world go through similar changes but at different time periods.Teach is great, even though the content did not interest me, the way he teaches pulls you into it. It's difficult to take your attention away from his lecture. He also includes some relevant videos which help clarify some difficult concepts. He encourages everyone to ask questions, and answers each one of them very well. I really enjoyed his teachingReally interesting content. You won't get bored in this class as the topics are interesting and applicable to our daily lives. I was taking Management at that time and I found that I was able to relate certain concepts to it as well. You will learn about the different scientific practices and technologies that affects how we work. Topics include bureaucracy, scientific management, taylorism, fordism, mcdonaldization of society etc.Prof teaches really well. He doesn't take attendance, and says in his very first class that he doesn't mind if you don't attend his lectures. But it is definitely worth it to go for his lectures as he shows videos and gives extra information. You won't fall asleep in class as he's able to deliver the content really well and provide interesting tidbits during lectures.This course start with introducing what is science and technology. Coming with scientific management, taylorism, fordism, deskilling, reskilling and bureaucracy... This course looks into how science and technology change our workplace through time."
2551,"There is irregular prs quiz, 5 in-class assignment done in group, midterm exam (25 mcs and 2 short questions), final exam (25 mcs and few short questions; not accumulative)."
2552,PRS may pop up sharp at the starting time of class. Most mcs in this course is examining how well you have memorized the course materials so they are quite easy. Only few of them are a bit tricky. The short questions in exams are quite straight forward too.
2553,The in-class group assignment is responding to one question with the reading materials and notes in a one page length answer. It might be a bit challenging in the first/ second time because of the time limit.Professor is very passionate. He explain key ideas very well through his deep analyze but somehow it may take up to half of the class time.
2554,"He is also very open minded. He welcome all kinds of comments or questions both in class and after class. He is very willing to adjust his teaching by asking us what he can improve, like the pace he speak, readings are needed or not. He also send us practice questions to prepare the midterm exam."
2555,"He also maintain a good atmosphere in the class by playing different music from youtube before class and in between break.You'd find that there re still serious gender discrimination and inequality everywhere even in the modern society today.I learn interesting facts and cases on the topic. I like the whole structure of the class, it encourages questioning and creative ideas.Interactive teaching style, nice English, guest lectures and video watching all the timeNo CommentThe instructor was very interactive with students. Lectures are well prepared with lots of real life examples and in-class activities. There are not a lot of content in powerpoints or notes. So although there is no attendance requirement, you have to attend the lectures as the contents and examples from impromptu in-class discussions will be tested.topic1: biology, sex and gender"
2556,topic2: inequality in everyday life
2557,topic3: men and women in the workplace and at home
2558,topic4: men and women in intimate relationships
2559,topic5: men and women in the global economy
2560,"The purpose of this courses is to let us develop a sociological mindfulness about the importance of gender in society. We will view gender as the product of culture, groups, and organizations. We are also required to pay attention to behaviors and ways of thinking that are so taken-for-granted that we fail to question them.The professor always encourages class discussion and is willing to answer students' questions, both in class and outside of class. He usually uses powerpoint to present his points and plays videos to illustrate opinions on the topic from different stakeholders. However, he is very strict on the use of mobile phones and laptop computers.The content was easy to be understood. It is about some common issues topics on Gender, such as gender violence, gender in the working environment, dating, and other interesting topics about gender.Basically, you have to read all of the readings before you attend each lesson. The lesson will be conducted based on the readings every week. There will be some discussions concerning on the gender topics within the classroom during lessons, and the powerpoint basically only pictures and examples, so you just need to read every reading to understand the topics.The course is divided into 5 parts"
2561,1. Biological sex and gender
2562,2. Inequality in everyday life
2563,3. Men and women in the workplace and the home
2564,4. Men and women in intimate relationships
2565,5. Men and women in the global economy
2566,Content are quite interesting as they all related to our daily life
2567,"However, when it comes to the real deal, that is not the case. I can learn little things from this course as there is not having any in-depth discussions in class. Though classes were funny sometimes, but the professors are clearly giving spending too much time letting us to express our views, and that is the main problem of the whole course."
2568,"If you were taking this course at the time like I do, you would absolutely be frustrated how ""messy"" this course is. You would expect 20-30% of the lecture time listening to different students raising up hands, talking some very common, basic things, that I think will not lead us to a more fruitful and productive discussion.No phone and notebook in class"
2569,Professor tried to show much short videos and documentaries to make the classes more interesting
2570,"Sometimes professor talked in a very soft and slow manner, making lectures a bit boring"
2571,"IF YOU ARE AN INTROVERTED OR TRADITIONAL HONG KONG STUDENT WHO DON'T REALLY SPEAK AT ALL. I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS COURSE. THAT 10% EXTRA CREDITS IS REALLY A BIG DEAL TO YOUR FINAL GRADE. IF YOU SPEND ALL THE TIME IN THE LECTURE SITTING STILL AND DO NOTHING SPEAKING, DEFINITELY YOU ARE GOING TO BE FXXXED IN YOUR GRADING, BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE AROUND 10% STUDENTS GETS MORE THAN 3% OF EXTRA CREDITS IN THIS COURSES DUE TO THEIR FREQUENT CONTRIBUTION.During lectures, he usually brings up a discussion question for the class to talk about. To make the class more interesting, he also show us short video clips about gender. Most of his power point notes are from the required or supplementary readings he gave us.He knows how to keep the class active by asking questions and showing us interesting video clips.Various interesting topics regarding to gender, for example, women rights and glass ceiling, were covered in class, on notes as well as in assigned readings. Things I learnt in class can also used in daily life discussion on other matters within sociological aspects.Prof. Groves often tried to make the class lively by adding videos, interesting discussions and even inviting people to give talks.The content covered gender in the workplace, gender in violence, issues such as homosexuality, and the development of gendered traits (males are supposed to be competitive, while females are supposed to be caring). This course really opens up everyone's mind and I recommend students to take this course.Brilliant. Dr. Groves is one of the best professors in UST. A lot of discussions take place in the classes. He actively engages students into contributing ideas in the class. He invites guest speakers to talk about the gender issues in the workplaces of Hong Kong.The purpose of this course is to answer these questions and others by developing a sociological mindfulness about how gender operates in our society. By sociologically mindful, I mean that we will view gender as the product of culture, groups, and organizations. I also mean that we will be paying attention to behaviours and ways of thinking that are so taken-for-granted that we often fail to question them, with an eye to examining the nature of inequality between men and women.  The course will be organized around five main topics: 1. Gender and Biology 2. Gender and Everyday Life  3. Gender at Work and in the Home  4. Gender and Intimate Relationships and 5. Gender in the Global Economy.  The focus of our discussions will be on gender issues in Hong Kong.He is really a good teacher. He initiates many discussion during the lesson in order to help us to understand more on the required readings. He also invites organisations outside to give us talk in order to provide us more information in the reality.The content is well designed and there are plenty of interesting things you can learn and be amazed. During and after the course, you may be able to understand why some of the gender issues are happening in this world in a more thorough and concrete manner. The content covers issue just as women in workplace, lesbian/gay, sexist language, and many more.Prof. Groves is amazing teacher. He presents idea very well in a very concise and sometimes funny manner. He likes to engage students in the class and listen to different opinions. I would definitely want to take many other courses he teaches next year2740 offers good insight into Gender Sociology, but it might feel one sided/too narrowly focused if you don't have a burning passion for Gender Studies/introductory Sociology knowledge. Having said that, it definitely changed the way I view the world. If you're just looking to fulfill an SA, I'd recommend 1850 with the same prof: varied, interesting, rich intro to Sociology. Groves is a brilliant lecturer.Brilliant lecturer. Engaging, interesting, has almost a stage presence. Best lecturer I've yet had. Groves implements case study + example-based learning approach, with supplementary videos and guest speakers. When I took it I think we had four guest speakers peppered throughout the term."
