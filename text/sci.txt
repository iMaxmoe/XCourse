A course of memorization and regurgitation of information.

You would learn what pi-donors (weak-field ligands), pi-acceptors (strong-field ligands) and sigma donors are; how to determine a transition metal complex's stability by calculating its splitting energy and hence its structure (tetrahedral? square planar? octahedral?);

how jahn-teller effect distorts a complex and affects its d-orbitals' splitting; organometallics (cyclo???enyl ligands);

how catalysts work (oxidative addition, reductive elimination, migratory insertion, cross-coupling);

main group elements; physical & chemical properties with respect to their kinetic/thermodynamic stability (poor orbital overlap? bond strength? vacant d-orbital? 2/3p-2/3p interaction? 2p pi-3d pi interaction?);

3-centre-2-electron-bond (B2H6) < 3-centre-4-electron bond ((AlCl3)2 etc.);

in what forms molecules of different main group elements would exist (dimer? polymer? covalent structure? ionic structure?)......

Too many things to recite. I can't remember all and do not bother to chase them out from my former course list hidden on Canvas to save leisure time.One of the best professors I have ever seen. Even though the teaching pace is sometimes too fast, it's still very clear and comprehensible. He is really eager to dispel any doubt you have and fairly friendly to us.  

So many iPRS questions during lessons to test your understanding, asked halfway every chapter, before recess and when every lesson ends.Content is very well designed in my opinion (I feel that I had learnt a lot). Content covers mostly transition elements and organometallic chemistry (both transition and main group organometallics). Various explanations on observed properties and phenomena are sought via concepts related to crystal field theory, MO, thermodynamics and kinetics. Notable topics include catalytic mechanism of transition metal catalyst and syntheses/reactions of a wide variety of compounds explained in terms of various theory (These are the topics that make me feel that I finally can do things which a chemist is supposed to be capable of).Very good teacher indeed. There is really not a single thing I can nitpick him.The principle of cosmetic product e.g.shampoo, whitening product,sunscreen,etc.
Most of the content are related to organic chemistry.
Apart from understanding the principle, also have to memorize quite a lot things to interpret the functions of cosmetic productsAlthough the content is quite complicated, the professor will explain clearly(sometimes a little bit fast as you have to take notes to help you understand the process)
Dennis is friendly, you can ask lots of questions after lessonsContent mostly includes the secondary school physics and some basic knowledge of chemistry. There are also some knowledge from A-level chemistry but do no worry as they are easy to understand if you go through all the lecture video.Professor will give brief revision and exercise in the beginning of each class, if you can do all the exercises in the power point there will not be any problems in your final and midterm. There are two assignments which are worth to do. 50% of final, 30% of midterm, 20% of assignmentsCh2-3: First &Second Law of Thermodynamics (AL Phys)
Ch4: Physical Transformations of Pure Substances
Ch5: Simple Mixtures
Ch6: Chemical Equilibrium
Ch15-16: Equilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics (F**king HARD)Direct reading from ppts every lesson. Tone quite weird.

Font of the alphabets used in ppts make them too thickly crowded.
There are virtually NO space lines between paragraphs, causing so much dizziness to read through them.

I don't question his professionalism, nor am I qualified for such, but I would strongly advise self-learning while avoiding class absence. They have to be combined though, unless you afford to fail and defer.Teaching topics:
1. First Law of Thermodynamics [Ch 2]
2. Second Law of Thermodynamics [Ch 3]
3. Physical Transformations of Pure Substances [Ch 4]
4. Simple Mixtures [Ch 5]
5. Chemical Equilibrium [Ch 6]
6. Equilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics [Ch 15,16]

The course is easy, statistical thermodynamics part should be taught more to deepen our understanding in stat. thermo.His teaching is quite boring.

Self-study is useful for understanding the thermodynamics deeply compared to his lecture.Description:
This 3-credit course is the Part-I of  “Physical Chemistry” sub-curriculum  for students majoring inchemistry. It covers  (a) The basic principles and applications of equilibrium thermodynamics; and(b)  The equilibrium statistical thermodynamics

Midterm Exam: 50%
(Chapter 2, 3, 4, 5)

Final Exam: 50%
(Chapter 5, 6, 15/16)  Not clear enough. Don't rely on lessons.
Mostly self-studying.Simple basic chemistry concepts are covered. ( atomic structure and periodicity, chemical bonding and molecular structure, basic properties of gases, liquids and solids, chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, and basic organic and biological molecules)He is one of the best professor that I ever met. His explanation is very clear and if you do not understand anything, he is willing to help you out during the office hour.Simple basic chemistry concepts
If you have a good grade in chem 1004,
you can also get a good grade in this course
It is similar to dse chem such as atomic structure and periodicity, chemical bonding and molecular structure...Very good

Boring.The content is interesting. It links with chem1004 and combined science .So if you think more about the content , you would be lighted.I just skipped almost all lessons.....But i heard some of my friends said that emily's voice is so good.good grade
midterm above 0.8sd
final above 1.3sd
quizes below mean
then A-
mean is around b-midterm all mc
final 50%mc 50%LQ
and the LQ is extremely easy,given that you have revised adequately.
2quizes with 15 mc each( 90mins) (more than enough time)Useful content. But most of them is the same with high school. Maybe you will find it too simple. But for students who haven't learnt chemistry, the content is just suitable.LI, Xiaoyuan is very responsible and teaches very well. He seldom ask students questions in class but he keeps talking very fast so that you need to pay attention.Not too difficult if you have taken chemistry class in high school before.
0. Measurement and Calculations in Chemistry
1. Chemical Foundations
2. Atomic Structure and Periodicity: many Qs were based on this chapter for the midterms.
3. Atoms to Molecules
4. Bonding - General Concepts
5. Molecular Structure and Orbitals: many short answer Qs were based on this chapter for the finals.
6. Chemical Energy
7. Gases
8. Liquids and Solids: did not have enough time to cover this topic.Clear teaching with good pronunciation. May be a bit boring for some of the contents.
The professor uploads student version PPTs with blanks here and there, so that the students take notes & fill in blanks in the student version PPTs during the lectures.The content is mostly aligned with chem1020, except the last 1-2 chapters skipped. This course is for students didn't study chem in their high school or who studied combined science in chemistry( I am the latter one).  The content is mostly irrelevant to the chem taught in high school as the first half (eg. orbital shapes) are from physics actually, but without the math. If you are interested in knowing the mathematical derivation of the orbital, I recommend phys2022(modern physics).I can feel that Professor is passionate in teaching, though his teaching is not fantastic, I would say, as his voice cannot attract the attention from students. Also I think he only teaches the content slides by slides without extra explanation or stories related to the content. This makes the lectures boring.Experiment 1: Identification of Polymers
Experiment 2: Forensic Examination of Pen Inks: Paper Chromatography
Experiment 3: Emission Spectrum of Atomic Hydrogen
Experiment 4: Determination of Iron Content by Redox Titration
Experiment 5: Determination of Boiling Point of An Unknown Liquid

Experiment 7: Molar Mass of a Volatile Liquid
Experiment 8: Determination of the Empirical Formula by Job’s Method
Experiment 9: Boyle’s Law

Basically most of them you have done it in high school and are really easy.To be honest very little teaching is required but I think the contents are explained well enough.
TAs/IAs are friendly and nice. They really want to go home as soon as possible though, a little impatient. But just ask them any questions when you encounter problem, they are very helpful and are really good at helping with any problems you might have.I think the content is just so-so. Some of the experiments are interesting.

Experiment 9: Boyle’s LawThe instructor has a little accent, but I think his explanation is ok.

I think all of TA(teaching assistant), IA(instructor assistant),etc. are very kind. But you may find some of them not so "friendly" at first. Take it easy! Ask them whenever you are confused.As this is a general chemistry lab, do not expect the experiments are interesting. To be precise, some of them may have appeared in high school, which does not make the content of this lab good. Do not expect to learn much from this lab.
Moreover, you may see some 'interesting' lab set-up such as using measuring cylinder when preparing solutions to do certain titration. This is not too reasonable.The teaching is alright, not much special. Instructors do not have very good pronunciation. Nevertheless, some IAs and TAs are quite helpful.Basic secondary experiments that are quite easy to do
Attendance requireAround 30 minutes introduction in the beginning before start the experiment. During your work, you can ask TA for help. They are nice and kind and are willing to answer your questions.Experiment 1: Identification of Polymers

Experiment 9: Boyle's Law5-15 mins briefing before doing experiments. Teaching was quite clear.
However, sometimes the powerpoint does not match with the lab manual.contain some secondary school experiment like titration.The instructor is very kind and nice so we won't feel stressful and he would remind us the main point before each experiment. The teaching assistant Joanne is extremely helpful. I am afraid of doing experiment and i am very scared.  I am always the last student to finish the experiment. Joanne always helps me to do and teach me how to do the worksheet.In the first lab section, he will explain the safety precaution and briefly introduce the outline of the course.

The first is to introduce the course, talk about safety precautions, some lab equipments and procedures. The next 9 sessions and experiments.

Experiment 8: Molar Mass of a Volatile Liquid
Experiment 9: Boyle’s LawDr. Yip is responsible for the briefing before each experiment. Mostly read out from ppt, with some demonstration/videos on some important procedures in the experiment.
The attitude of IAs/TAs are at least ok to me. Some are more friendly, but some will respond to student's questions with a cold tone. They are usually willing to demonstrate some difficult lab procedures(such as pouring liquid to a burette) or remind students how should they dispose of the chemical wastes.Similar to secondary school chem, is just a course you how to use the experiment apparatus. An easy course, what you need to do is just follow the lab manual to do the experimentmainly do experiments and the instructor will remind the key procedures of the experiments. Some TA are not very nice.There are total 9 labs and 1 briefing session on lab safety.

Experiment 9: Molar Mass of a Volatile Liquid

Most of the experiments are boring.All the Dr Yip's teaching could be found in the lab manual. But the exam contains out-syl scientific thinking questions more than the in-content questions.Some basic concepts of physics and chemistry are included in the experiment.  The experiments are not too difficult to be done and follow the instructions should be fine.  You need to submit a lab report in class after each experiment.

Major topics include:
1. Density of an Egg
2. Paper Chromatography
3. Emission Spectrum of Atomic Hydrogen
4. Hess’s Law: Calculation of Heat of Neutralization between Strong Acid and Strong Base
5. Boyle’s Law
6. Determination of Boiling Point of Unknown Liquid
7. Kinetic Studies of Chemical Reaction
8. Le Châtelier’s Principle
9. Molar Mass of a Volatile LiquidA 10-15 minute briefing session will be held before starting to do the experiment.  Then you need to do the experiment individually and submit the lab report.  You can ask the TAs if you have any questions about the experiment.I don't think the course really complemented General Chemistry I, but the concepts behind the experiments weren't too difficult. Following the lab manual instructions will yield proper results.

9. Molar Mass of a Volatile LiquidThe Professor would give a 10, 15-minute briefing about the experiments each time, but I was placed in a bad position that I could not see him. He sometimes gives necessary information for the experiment, but mostly you can just find it in the lab manual. Do ask the TAs if you have any questions.A course which attracts students who do not wish to take 4 credit course if they have registered CHEM 1020.
Apply what you have learned in high school in labs.
Reminds you the good old days in laboratories, and gain experience of performing experiments in a university.Instructor goes through what we should do in the lab for 15 mins, and he will leave the duty to his lab technicians.

You can grab a chance to know more friends in this course, such as the one who sits next to you. Lab technicians are glad to answer the questions, if you meet the right one. I once met a pretty girl in this course, but this chance does not belong to me...

REMEMBER TO TELL THE LAB TECHNICIANS THAT YOU HAVE FINISHED THE LAB AND ASK THEM TO CHECK OUT!!!

If you didn't do so, your marks on lab report ( the 40% one) will be deducted.One of the Awfullest course I have ever taken since secondary school. Obscure teaching foci showcasing a landfill of topics.

Some people, including me, may commonly find that we simply don't know what have been learned from this course as if we have been injected with unknown sedatives and knocked unconscious for some time until being able to wake up after the final.

It's hard to illustrate explicitly, but it may not be necessary to draw characters transparent enough to see their intestines.   

Powerpoints are quite messy. Too much dazzling newspaper clipping between pages, virtually severing the important points and making it really difficult to grasp them.

So many key concepts required for assignments and exams are not included in the lecture slides.

You may argue that learning is a process of self-exploration, but it may not be responsible for a professor to expect the student gets everything on his own, despite it probably being within his capacity, because the student does not only take your course.

All in all, this is the worst course in the 4-year Chemistry curriculum and perhaps throughout my career as a student.Prof. Chan is adorably corpulent. His baldness is funnily obvious that he seems to be an exemplar of a feverishly dedicated scientist having his senescence accelerated by decades.

Listening to his preaching may be kind of enjoyment if your concern is not completely about how good he teaches.

I should be honest to mention, for others' good sake, that he tends to read directly from powerpoints, discouraging student's persistent attendance, except for those who are highly immune to boredom.The content is all about the general chemical analytical methods. F-test ,
T-test, closely related to the required textbook.The professor liked to ask question to some students. He could even remember some of their names. He would ask for yr name too in order to know who u are. Remember to attend the class if the professor could recognise you.Almost all chapters from Harris textbook was covered. 13 chapters for mid-term, mostly on data analyses, unit conversions and statistics, but not much calculations. Final was the rest of the chapters, mostly on different analytical techniques, GC, LC, MS etc. Cheat sheet allowed but wasn't too useful,  quite a few questions on parts and functions of analytical instruments which I hated, plus one essay question on devising an experiment.Average, understandable but sometimes it was quite hard to catch everything the instructor said. Lecture notes were typical and not very inspiring, but if you dont pay attention in class there will be areas you won't understand fully, and he would probably test it in exams.Cover almost the entire textbooks. 13 chapters for midterm and about 10 chapters for final. Mostly about understanding and less calculation. Very practical knowledge and not as difficult to understand compared to organic chemistry.Going to his class will be helpful, because the lecture notes itself is quite abstract and not much information written on it. Most of the materials can be understood easily, but sometimes his explanation can be quite long and not so efficient. Asking him questions will help.Topics:

Introduction to environmental analytical chemistry
Fundamentals of trace component analysis Fundamentals of pollutants and their measurement Determination of airborne carbonyls
Determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the  atmosphere
Continuous monitoring of air pollutants
Measurements of water quality
Measurements of metals in water
Analysis of ions in natural water
Analysis of metals and pesticides in contaminated soil samples
Quality control for environmental analysis

Some topics are interesting, but most topics have too many irrelevant and unnecessary details about specific instrumental parameters.

Too much content- ~18 PPTs with 30-40 slides each = 500-600 slides in total.

Topics are very complex. This course only has CHEM 2310 / 2311 as prerequisite, but don't take the course unless you have also done CHEM 3320 Instrumental analysis or CHEM 4330 Separation science. Very hard to understand all the complex analytical techniques.He just reads off the PPTs in every lecture. Can get very boring and difficult to follow with interest. Attendance became quite low later in the term, because it's the same as just reading the PPT at home.September: Review on AN Chem I, sig.fig., error propagation, basic calculations, etc.
October: Airborne Analysis
November: Water Analysis, Soil Analysis

Including sampling, derivatization, working principle and detection limit of every method.Standard introductory analytical chemistry topics.  I like the way Henry also included a light touch of statistics.

Before Mid Term [calculation-based]:
Basic statistics (very basic statistical inferences, student t, t-test, f-test)
Classical methods (gravimetric and titrimetric analyses, separation methods and calculation)

After Mid Term [principle-based]:
Instrumental methods (spectroscopy, chromatography, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry)One of the best professors I have ever met in UST.  

Extremely passionate and dedicated to students.  Explains important concepts over and over and over again to make sure everyone understands them.  He also makes the lectures less boring by being humorous and sharing us his past experiences.

Gives review powerpoints and lectures before exams, sends you important questions from students and his answers.The content is not that rich in my opinion. Before midterm, the content mostly covers the basics of analytical chemistry  (concept of uncertainty and statistics) and basic techniques to conduct chemical analysis (calibration, sampling, gravimetric and titrimetric analysis). The next part covers instrumental analysis (spectroscopy, chromatography, mass spectrometry and electrochemistry) at the introductory level.Prof. Henry Yan is good in terms of teaching. Sometimes he made some mistakes but he is very responsible and would always make up for his mistakes. However, the thing I don't like is that the exams are not designed well to be honest, many questions are just direct copying from the notes/textbook. Also, the level of difficulty is way too low so that it simply differentiates people based on cautiousness or whether they have read the notes instead of testing people on the thorough understanding of the content.The content is easy to understand.
-Qualitative or quantitative measurements
-Statistical methods
• Chromatography
• Titration methods,
• Spectroscopic methods,  
• Other instrumental analysis, GC-Mass, combines chromatography and spectroscopyProf. Yan He is very nice and always share some of his stories during the lectures.
He also tries to narrow down the syllabus that involves complicated concepts.

He provided summary notes before the midterm and final for our revision and go through the important questions and notes before the exam.Since this course was basically made for students that are not in chemistry major, that require the knowledge of analytical chemistry, the contents are more general in comparison to that of CHEM 2310. Content list includes:

Uncertainty
Statistics (t-test, f-test, etc.)
Standardization
Samples
Gravimetry
Titration
Spectroscopy
Chromatography
Mass Spec
Electrochemistry

If you have done IB/A-level before, and have done analytical chemistry as part of your syllabus, then this subject would be a lot more bearable for you. Many of the contents covered are already covered in the IB analytical chemistry section.Since the teaching is in form of lectures, it is pretty much the most standard course in this area. The prof is very nice, so if you approach him for clarification/other questions, he answers it very patiently. His accent is not that bad, it was not a trouble understanding his lectures.The lecture will be not too hard if you have already taken some analytical chemistry classes during high school. This course is aimed for those who are no majoring in chemistry, so the content is not very deep but worth establishing background knowledge about analytical chemistry.
What we learned was uncertainty calculation, statistics, standardization, sampling, gravimetry, titration, spectroscopy, chromotography, mass spec, electro chemistry.Prof. he is a very enthusiastic teacher. He really wants everyone to get good grades. It is quite important to attend the lecture as he emphasizes lots of things and they appear on the exam pretty much.

His English accent is cute but sometimes, it is hard to understand what he wants to tell us. It is not due to the accent and when I checked the video link again, I found he jumps to the next slide without ending the sentence. Anyway, he is a nice teacher.The content is not too much. The canvas has provided all of the PPT and also some reading materials for the students. Before the mid-term or final, the professor will post some Q&A for us to study and list out which chapters needed to revise.The professor is a very kind person. He is willing to help us by solving our questions no matter during the lesson or in the email. His English is above average compared to other mainland professors.the content is not difficult if u go through all lecture video or go to the lecture and jot notes. He tells all the key point of the exam in the lecture.teaching is good. he encourage us to ask questions after the lecture. We can learn more by asking more.grading is ok. if u get the mean, normally b-.But if u only view the lecture note, I will be not enough for exam as  u dont know the area to assess.workload is not heavy. Normally, most of the hws have ans.
remember to attend the lectures for taking attendance. He will tell u the exact date.This courses is slightly different from CHEM 2310, as this one is meant for non-Chem majors (like ENVS, etc.), so the content is more general and doesn't go as deep as 2310 in the topics. Topics include:
Uncertainty
Statistics (t-test, f-test, etc.)
Standardization
Samples
Gravimetry
Titration
Spectroscopy
Chromatography
Mass Spec
Electrochemistry

The content is quite interesting and not too difficult or complex to understand even without much chemistry background (only General Chemistry I is a prerequisite). This course is a requirement for courses like Environmental Chem and Separation Science.Prof. Yan is one of the best professors I have had. He is extremely passionate, thorough, clear and very helpful. He always tries to make his lectures fun and explains the relevance of what he is teaching to us. He provides a lot of support outside lectures too, he is always open to any questions even on the last day before the exam, and keeps uploading helpful documents like Q&A from other students, list of equations to memorize, etc.The course content can largely be divided into two parts, separated by the midterm examination.
Before the midterm, the contents are more calculations-oriented, as the course revolves around basic statistical tools like T-test, F-test etc.; Also included here are methods for standardization, sampling, and basic analyses like gravimetric analysis and titrimetric analysis.
After the midterm, the focus shifts to understanding the concepts underlying analytical methods like spectroscopy, electrochemistry and chromatography. (in which understanding = recitation in exams T.T)
The course contents are generally not difficult to understand and some even coincided with CHEM1030. Explains the (unfortunately) high mean in the course.Not the most proficient English speaker, but largely makes up for it with his humour and passion.
He is very devoted to his teaching and would post Q&As as well as tips for the exams on canvas. He also tries and make sure every student understands what he taught, and would devote at least 20 minutes each lecture to recap the previous lecture.Pre-midterm: inorganic chemistry and concepts (bonding, stereochemistry, shit like that)
Post-midterm: reactions x n (mind you, all of which need to be utterly and completely memorized for the final)He has the most laughably Chinese accent I've heard, and it's monotonous, dreary and sounds like he has a mouthful of shit.
Good luck trying not to drop dead in class.
Half the class skived off, even when he sent out notices that were like "I'll be talking about important shit tomorrow/the exam/if you don't come I'll flunk your ass" so yeah, you can probably guess how terrible he isThis course has a very detailed content covering most of high school organic chemistry. the topics start off easy, giving you a false sense of security, but literally make your life miserable later. some of the topics covered include: structure and bonding,acids and bases, alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, alkynes,alkyl halides, complex reaction mechanisms, alcohols and phenols, ethers and epoxides.
Basically an awful lot to cover in a short time.Horrendous, monotonous, just plain boring. The content is very complicated in itself, and his teaching style does not help in any way. it is very hard to follow what he's saying and explaining. There are no lecture videos, and trust me, you wouldn't want to watch them anyway. I literally studied most of the content myself from the book, which does a fairly decent job.Begins with basics like drawing lewis structures, newman projections, naming, R/S stereochemistry and resonance structures. Then its about certain functional groups like alcohols, thiols, ether, epoxide, alkene, alkyne, aromatics. Its all what basic organic chemistry courses entail in most unis probably.
I have attached the file with the intro stuff.
The issue is not with that, but the amount of memorization and actual practice required to master these concepts. What I found the worst was that we begin with making C-C-O-H and are expected to master synthesizing compounds within a span of 3 months, which is INSANE.Okay, this one is tough. He's unclear and monotone = recipe for disaster when it comes to teaching us easily bored students.
Prof's accent is super hard to understand most times, unless you specifically pay attention to every word (which takes a LOT of energy). His explanations are further worsened by simple, unclear statements with terminology thrown around. There is no lecture video, which wouldn't help anyway since his
He does try to make class interesting by adding "real-life" examples or applications made by his students in the lab BUT it only confuses students further.Before mid-term:
Bonding, Lewis Acid and Bases, Alkanes, Cycloalkanes, isomerism, Alkene structure, organic reaction principals.

After mid-term:
Alkenes, Alkynes, Organohalides, Alcohols, phenols, Ethers, Epoxide, Thiol, Sulphides

So you may be looking at all this and wondering - I know some organic chemistry from highschool, this shouldn't be tooo hard, or how hard can this be?? Well I was just as naive as you, but in reality this course starts of really easy and just skyrockets, nothing makes any sense after the 4th or 5th chapter, and after the mid term you have to remember over 60 different reaction mechanisms, each of which has their unique condition and the mechanism drawings are too complicated, while almost all the reactions look the same. Whats worse is that you don't even understand the purpose of these reagents - like why this temperature, why this metal, why can't another metal be used? and even for the same reaction there may be 3 or 4 different conditions for them. Be expected to be able to recall some 500 pages of textbook which all look the same.

There was far too much content for such a short amount of time, and issue is none of it makes sense, you are only memorising them for exams thats it. This is made worse with the "teaching" that goes with it, the professor is just like a museum exhibit person - 'this is the reaction that converts ... to ....' points at it for a few seconds and moves on, without actually elaborating??  yet we need to know how to draw it. The textbook itself has sooo much details (the textbook is the lifesaver) yet the ppts had more details which he just skims through. He spends so much time describing his own lab research, which nobody is actually interested in, and ends up saying 'this is not needed for exams'. While there is a bunch of stuff which are just randomly there, do we need it or not? most of the ppt is actually just copied and pasted from the textbook, however excluding the important parts which actually attempt to explain it.

And then comes exams - after you gone mad from trying to remember the content, he creates these super hard exam which looks nothing like what you studied. Like in the mid-term he expected us to recall the structure of some organic molecules from the top of our heads ?? like we were never told to memorize this? and the finals was just much worse - the last few questions we had to design this 14-15 step pathway - I can't even get a lot of the reaction mechanisms right and you expect us to derive 14-15 step mechanism?I am going to be objective here rather than straight up dissing (trust me soooo many have done so already), lets analyse the facts!

1) The mean of the mid-term and finals has failed (below 50%)
2) Out of over 200 people in the class, the attendance is less than 20 (take a hint)
3) Lecture notes are unclear and has too much irrelevant stuff that nobody cares about. While the important parts lack detail and are exactly copied and pasted from the textbook.
4) A majority of students solely use the textbook or youtube videos for revision, and this is one of the most well known 'self-taught' course
5) Most students don't actually understand the content after the lecture (I mean those that attend) - many have stated that it is partially because of his dull and mundane teaching style.
6) At the end of the course, we actually have no clue how these organic synthesis reactions occur in the lab, we only memorize so many reactions yet have no idea how this is done in the lab.- way too much content in a short amount of time, especially after the mid term. Estimation of probably 55-60 pathways/mechanisms that needed to be learnt AND applied to complicated molecules in the exam. (PS if you have done IB HL chemistry and thought this wont be too bad, you'll be proven wrong- the HL content will probably be the easiest stuff that will be covered in this course)
-each lecture powerpoint is very lengthy- he covers a lot of content in a short amount of time-- too fast and may be difficult to take in so much all at once.
-exam content is way more difficult than the textbook, which he claims to be following for teaching this course.
-ppts sometimes include complicated pathways that arent in the textbook- ppts also lack explanation. ~85% of ppt are diagrams with no explanation.-skims through powerpoint, lots of irrelevant info on the powerpoint that he may spend time explaining, only to tell you its not needed for the exams.
-suspected to tip off certain students about exam info. Eg: last question on the final exam was seen worked out in the scihome whiteboard before the exam. (which was a 10 mark question on synthetic pathways, the right solution having 13 steps)
-expect to be your own teacher if you take this course!! :) free youtube lectures and the textbook is your saviorits difficult. the mechanisms were complicated and the powerpoint notes did not show the mechanism clearly and there was no lecture videos provided so i couldn't watch and pick up easily.he got accents and he couldn't illustrate his points clearly. But I could see Tong did try hard in making us to learn something.The content was mainly about some basic properties of organic compounds and function groups, such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, etc. Many synthesis would be covered in the final part.Very unfluent and hardly understandable English. The time slot was bad (4:30pm-5:50pm). Therefore, very few people is willing to attend the class. For me, mostly was based on self-study.Basically talked about the structures and properties of different functional groups. The content is easies before midterm, mainly including few concepts such as bonding theory and acid and base. After midterm, more specific reactions and mechanisms are covered, which also needs a lot of time to remember.Prof Tong's teaching sometimes could be boring, especially discussing the reactions, but generally is not too bad.A lot of new knowledge on organic reactions, mechanisms, syntheses, but not enough time to master them. Course is taught too fast and too many things crammed into one semester.Prof teaches fast, talks too fast, doesn't update pdf with in-class questions, so if you can't follow in class, well...The course give me a glance how organic chemistry looks like. If you try to clear the concepts after every lesson, it can be easier when it comes to midterm and final exam.Professor's accent was relatively hard for me to understand what he was talking about. I skip nearly all the lessons after midterm.Overall useful. Content before midterm was fairly easy (I mean easier than what I heard of). Final exam portion was difficult, mainly due to mechanisms which require a great amount of time to memorize it.Professor's English was not the worst, but sometimes it was hard to understand due to his Chinese accents. His voice was monotonic, easily falling into sleep.To me, the content is just right, not too many, and not too few.
  The first part is the basic things, which includes orbitals, drawing structures, orbital hybridization, formation of bonds, molecular shape and bond polarity. Then comes acid and bases, with detailed discussion on the factors affecting acid strength. After that would be alkanes and cycloalkanes, in which their limited amount of reactions are mentioned. Conformations of both cyclo- and aliphatic alkanes are discussed, which is followed by stereochemistry. A brief discussion on the various types of reaction and how to draw reaction mechanisms is taught before midterm.
  After midterm is comes the physical chemistry of reactions, including kinetics and energetics. Then, various functional groups and their typical reactions are discussed. Functional groups mentioned include alkenes, alkynes, alkyl halides, alcohols, epoxides, ethers, thiols and sulfides. An in depth discussion on SN2, SN1, E2 E1 and E1cb mechanisms is inserted after the alkyl halides.Quite good. The instructor is from mainland, so he speaks with an accent, but his english is still quite clear and understandable. Pace not too fast. At the start of every powerpoint is a summary of the last powerpoint and a revision question, which facilitates consolidation of knowledge of the past powerpoint. Very patient on answering questions, often a long queue would appear after class, waiting to ask questions. It is not rare to take half an hour for the queue to disappear.The topics are:
(i) Introduction
(ii) Molecular Structures and Bonding
(iii) Acids and bases
(iv) Structures of simple solids
(v) Molecular symmetry

(vi) Introduction to coordinatioin chemistry
(vii) Periodic characteristics of compounds

There are lecture vidoes. There is a textbook. The content can be found from textbook. Some are related to lab-work.
Textbook is “Inorganic Chemistry”, 6thedition, by Mark Weller et al., OUP (2014)

Reference books: “Inorganic Chemistry”, 4thedition, by C. E. Housecroft and A. G. Sharpe, Pearson (2012)
“Inorganic Chemistry”, 3rd/4thedition, by Gary Miessler and D. A. Tarr, PearsonThe professor is excellent and nice. His teaching is clear. Lecture videos are provided. We can feel free to ask him any questions. The concept taught is clear. However he taught very fast. And sometimes he tells jokes and have Chinese ascent. The powerpoint is clear, some is quoted from textbook.Molecular Structure and Bonding
Acids and Bases
Structures of Simple Solids
Molecular Symmetry
Introduction to Coordination Chemistry
Periodic Characteristics of Compounds

The amount of content is adequate and not difficult to understand. I would say that molecular symmetry might be the most challenging topic of the course, but it is still comprehensible.Prof. Leung is a great instructor. He talks using simple language so that students are not confused by terms they never heard of. He is also helpful and responds quickly to questions. After class, he is very patient when answering students' questions.Molecular orbital
Ligand group orbital
acid and base (Bronsted, Lewis, Hard soft)
Structure of simple solids (7 crystal systems, lattice energy, semiconductors)
Molecular symmetry (Group theory, IR spectrum, Raman spectroscopy, vibration mode)
Introduction to coordination chemistry (geometry, isomerism, transitional metals)
Some basic periodic trendsProf Leung really nice, he teaching was really really good (maybe due to he is a local prof).
During final exam, he even gave us a few minutes to read the paper, and ask him questions if you do not understand.I would say the arrangement of content is reasonable, and it doesnt really ask to memorize a lot once the student comprehend the concepts.prof LEUNG is helpful and kind, always replies the emails in time and explains clearly. personally i think he is the best prof i have met this semester, however  i feel he compromises a lot in many aspects.The content is appropriate but not particularly interesting (and it is pretty abstract at some points). I suggest it has missed some elements on how the knowledge in this course can be applied to real life circumstances. The main content includes MO theory, acid-base theory, solid structure and property, band theory, molecular shape and symmetry, IR spectroscopy and finally crystal field theory. If you have a strong background in introductory level physical and inorganic chemistry concepts (bondings e.g. MO, coulombic force, intermolecular force; structure e.g. VSEPR; thermodynamics etc.), then you would find this course not too difficult.Prof. Leung is a knowledgeable, responsible and humble teacher. Nice experience to be a student under his teaching.Topics:
Molecular Structure and Bonding
Solid States
Acids and Bases
Molecular Symmetry
Coordination Chemistry
Periodicity

The topics build on the content in CHEM 1010 and CHEM 1030. Moderate difficulty level.He does not explain the topics clearly at all. Often skips some parts of the lectures. The lectures are recorded and uploaded online, which is good because it's at 9 am, but still not helpful. Revision for exams is almost impossible because the lecture notes he uploads are completely useless. Most of them have only pictures and diagrams with no text information to explain them.Chapter 9: Liquids and Solids

Chapter 18: The Nucleus: A Chemist’s View
Chapter 19: The Representative Elements
Chapter 20: Transition Metals and Coordination ChemistryAlthough Prof Lin's accent is very special, he shows strong passion to make the lesson more interesting. It is not very difficult what he is saying.I'd like to say that the contents are really easy because all of them are covered in the general chemistry and the word "general" means every one can understand it if he spends some efforts on it. So do not worry about it. Just attend every lecture and do you best.As the head of the Department of Chemistry, I have to say Lin is a good teacher. His lectures are easy to follow and understand. Because of the same reasons, if you understand what he is teaching, you may easily fall asleep.Stoichiometry

Transition Metal and Coordination ChemistryTeaching was clear and he can explain the concept well, he was willing to answer students question clearly after the end of lectures, which can clarify some of the difficult concepts encountered in some topics. There are random attendance during the lectures, 5 students will be randomly selected and 1% will be deducted if you are absent.Topics are still related with high school chemistry, not that too hard as long as you review his lecture notes.His teaching was clear enough, you can always approach him to ask questions and he is willing to answer you during the break time in class. He also let the class ended earlier sometimes. However, he also took random attendance in every class.Continuation of CHEM 1010/1020 (General Chemistry IA/IB). Topics include:
Stoichiometry
Solutions
Acids and Bases
Complex Ions
Spontaneity and Entropy
Electrochemistry
Nuclear Chemistry
Representative Elements
Coordination Chemistry

Content is not too hard. This is a prerequisite for higher chemistry courses such as Organic or Inorganic Chemistry.Teaching was clear and he explained the concepts well. But the lectures can be quite boring and monotonous at times. A lot of people skip them as the lecture slides and video recordings of the lectures are uploaded online, and the lectures are at 9:00 am.Main content include:
- solution (concentration, solubility, equilibrium...)
- acid and base (nature of acid and base, pH and pK, buffer and neutralization...)
- thermochemistry (enthalpy, entropy, free energy...)
- electrochemistry (redox, cell and cell potential, electrolysis...)
- nuclear chemistry and radioactivity
- chemistry pattern
- transitional elements and coordination chemistry (bond model for transitional elements, isomerism, etc...)Lin was willing to answer student's question despite his strange English accent.The course covers topics that students more or less have some basic ideas from HKDSE Chem. It is kinda like an extension of a few DSE topics which includes some A-level stuffs. Not a difficult course, but make sure you really understand the concepts taught. I think students who are interested in chemistry would be interested in this course :)

1) Topics included in the mid-term exam:
-Chapter 9:Liquids and Solids
-Chapter 10:Properties of Solutions
-Chapter 13:Acids and Bases
-Chapter 14:Acid-Base Equilibria
-Chapter 15:Solubility and Complex Ion Equilibria

DSE topics with newer concepts. The content is quite easy, I would say the calculations about the equilibria is the hardest part (harder than those in DSE).

2) Topics include in the final exam:
-Chapter 16: Spontaneity, Entropy, and Free Energy
-Chapter 17: Electrochemistry
-Chapter 18:The Nucleus: A Chemist’s View
-Chapter 19:The Representative Elements
(wasn't taught and included in the final as there wasn't enough time to teach plus this topic is simple, Prof. Lin just encouraged us to read it at home)
-Chapter 20:Transition Metals and Coordination Chemistry

These chapters dig deeper into some DSE topics (except chapter 18, which is more or less included in DSE Physics), but generally they aren't very hard to understand and are interesting. As long as students understand the concepts, it would be fine to handle the final.Prof. Lin, as mentioned in many other reviews also, teaches with passion, explains things well and clear.
Also, he is nice, just feel free to ask him questions if you don't understand or aren't clear about the concepts.

The instructional assistant KaHo is also very helpful and always answers students' questions with clear explanations.

I am sure that you can understand the knowledge if you work hard.the grading is quite nice. if your scores are higher than the mean around 0.5 sd, mostly you will get B.

Ch. 14 and 20 are the hardest topics.
Final exam only tests Ch. 16-20Prof. Lin...yes, he is very enthusiastic in teaching and have loud and clear English, but both his presentations and his lecture notes lacks a clear logic flow so it is not easy to understand what he is talking about. He can answer questions clearly though.This general chemistry course consists of different sorts of calculations related to properties of aqueous solution, equilibrium (acid-base, buffer, solubility), thermodynamics, electrochemistry and nuclear chemistry. The hardest part in my opinion is thermodynamics as it really takes you quite some time to digest all the concepts. However, the most crucial part in the exam is equilibrium because it is being tested most and its concepts are key to the understanding of other parts as well. A quite well-designed course in my opinion in terms of enriching students' basic knowledge of chemistry.Prof. Lin is a good teacher, he can deliver contents efficiently. He is also a very responsible and knowledgeable person in my opinion.The course first covers principles of electrochemical analysis, chromatography and mass spectroscopy before mid term exam. After that , it talks about light transmittance , NMR,etc.The lecture was quite boring and the professor would mostly refer to what had been mentioned on the lecture notes. Therefore, revising the lecture notes and finish the sample exam paper is my tactic to the course,rather than just sitting the lectureExperiment 1: Identification of Ionic, Covalent and Metallic Bonds

However, it is very important to focus on her saying and jot down notes during briefing as what she said will be on the final exam.This course includes 9 experiments, all the theories in which are learned from CHEM 1030. Each experiment occupies only about 6 pages of the lab manual. Many of the techniques and calculations are related to titration and are taught in high school already.The instructors explains the procedures and principles clearly prior the experiment. Remember to jot down any notes that are in the PowerPoints but not in the lab manual such as some chemicals which are not stated. Listen carefully to the instructions of TAs when they are teaching about the skills of handling glass wares like the proper way to hold a dropper. Many of the above will be examined. Besides, it is better to do pre-lab preparation thoroughly since some TAs may ask you questions suddenly and monitor if you make mistakes through out the experiment.Chapter 1  Introduction: Matter and Measurements

-------NON-CUMULATIVE final--------------

Chapter 1 2 6 7 8 9 are very easy, however, you still need to spend some time on the concepts in order not to make any careless mistakes.

Chapter 3~5 are somewhat hard to digest and you need to spend some time to understand the theories behind.

I would say the contents are not well-organized. They are kind of messy, though most of them are useful to future chem study.His English accent is a bit hard to understand but you can manage to get used to it after a short while.

He mainly reads the PowerPoint, and some supplement may be added from time to time, which may be useful.

The PPT's are well-prepared. Also the lecture videos will be provided, so you don't necessarily need to attend the lecture.

My suggestion is that you only need to attend the first 2 lectures, the 2 lectures before midterm (because the lecture videos may not be uploaded immediately).Ch 1  Introduction: Matter and Measurements
Ch 2  Chemical Foundations
Ch 3  Atomic Structure and Periodicity

Most of them are learnt in DSE, there are some new formulas about orbitals and gases, ch 4,5 are new. Final exam won't include content in mid-term.JIA usually reads the ppt aloud with some clarifications, he spends many time to do review questions in lectures so the teaching process is very slow (he went through very fast in last few lectures as result), but he still ends up lectures on time.

JIA's accent is hard to hear at the beginning, but he is friendly and willing to answer your questions (Also IA).

There are tutorials held by IA before mid-term and final exam, it's recommended to attend. Review questions and homework really help  understanding the concepts.

All teaching materials (including lecture videos) can be found in Canvas, it's up to you to attend lectures or not.

The most difficult topic will be Atomic Orbitals and Molecular Orbitals. The others are quite similar to what have taught in dse-level chem.Not bad.
Professor Jia doesn't speak clearly and has a 'special' accent. It is a bit hard to understand his English at first, but will be fine when you get used to it. He follows the powerpoint slides directly. However, he is willing to answer students' questions during and after the lectures.

Chapter 1_ Matter and MeasurementActually prof has a poor pronunciation compared to other profs...and he always just reads the ppt. But he is nice and responsible. If you ask him some questions, he will explain to you quite patiently.Contain some secondary school knowledge.
The topics include chemical foundation,atomic structure and periodicity, bonding, molecular structure and orbital, stoichiometry, types of chemical reactions and solution stoichiometry,chemical energy and enthalpy.
Chapter 2 which is orbital is notably difficult. Many of my friends did not understand. The mean of mid term exam is thus very low which is only 47/90.He didn't explain the concepts clearly and he always asked us to self-study as his lecture only discussed some concepts. Lecture video is provided.Content: Mostly DSE Chemistry and elaboration of DSE Physics "atomic world' elective module with A-Level atomic orbital syllabus.

DSE Chem and Phy student would have a better grasp in this course.

Powerpoint are decent but not thoroughly explained.
Searching help on the Internet (Khan Academy) is recommended.Poor presentation, read-through of powerpoint only.
Teaching is not intriguing.
It is difficult to hear JIA's accent. I recommend sitting at the front for better listening.
TA (KaChung) is very helpful and welcoming for student's questions.Before mid-term:
Classification of matter, Elements and Periodic table, Measurements and significant figures, atoms, ions, molecules, compounds, Atomic spectra and the Bohr model, Quantum mechanical model(Wave-particle duality, Quantum numbers, energy and shapes of atomic orbitals, polyelectronic atoms), Periodic trends in atomic properties, Ionic bonding, Covalent bonding, Lewis Structures(Resonance, Formal Charges), VSEPR

After mid-term:
Valence Bond Theory and hybridization, Molecular Orbital Theory, Chemical stiochiometry, Reactions in aqueous solutions(Properties, precipitation, acid-base, redox), Chemical energy(1st law of thermodynamics, enthalpy, Hess' Law), Gases(Properties, gas laws, Kinetic Molecular Theory, Ideal and real gases)

More than half of the course are used to teach Bohr model, Quantum mechanical model, Lewis Structures, VSEPR Theory, Valence Bond Theory and Molecular Orbital Theory. They are the most important content in this course(and in Chemistry).Prof. Jia's English is significantly poorer than other professors, but the accent is still understandable. He mostly read from ppt slides directly, without much elaboration. There are good examples, exercise and 'review questions' in the ppts, but he didn't spend a lot of time to explain the questions and the answers. He is willing to answer student's questions, but he frequently shift between speaking English and Mandarin when answering questions, so we can't get his answer really well.This is a two credit course, but the content is quite a lot.
The topics include:
1. Chemical Foundation
2. Atomic Structure and Periodicity
3. Atoms To Molecules
4. Bonding General Concepts
5. Molecular Structure and Bonding
6. Chemical EnergyThe lecturer has passion in Chemistry. However, his teaching is quite boring as he just read out the ppt slides.Reviewing all the basic Chemistry you have learned in high school.
There is a new concept introduced which is orbitals.
This is the essence of this course, if you understand the concepts of orbitals, getting a B range or A range is easy.The professor shows his passion in Chemistry, but his tone is boring and many people choose to skip lessons. There also people talk loudly in his lectures, and he need to stop sometimes when he delivers a speech.The content being taught in CHEM1020 is largely different from what I had learnt for Chemistry subject in HKDSE. Therefore, it is quite hard to handle the course even though you had done pretty well in DSE. That is mainly because the content in CHEM1020 is sort of abstract. It is not an easy job to understand the concepts thoroughly. Therefore, the course is pretty time-consuming since it takes time for you to revise before the tests.To be honest, teaching of Prof JIA, Guocheng is not very satisfied. The major problem about his teaching is his strong accent, it caused the students not able to get what he said.Chapter 1.   Introduction: Matter and Measurements

Chapter 7.    Chemical reactions in aqueous solution
Chapter 8.    Thermochemistry: Chemical Energy
Chapter 9.   Gases
most of the content are covered in high school. But as it is a 2 credit course this year but 3 next year, the content next year may be more than that.The instructor is patient and the teaching speed is slow acceptably especially for the most important parts. There are two versions of ppt(before and after class) which are quite useful for preview and review.
No comments on the IA and TAs because I did not see them many times.
The course is only 50minutes and only 2 tutorials before mid-term and final (should be different next year)Only orbital is new, every other thing was covered in secondary schoolI didn't attend any class. However. The tutorial is very important as it may give out some exam related knowledge.Overall above mean about 1.3 and Got A. Score is about 85% while assignment is 9x%Only 2 assignment then midterm and final so very low workload. Moreover, as it doesn't take attendance, the time slot is actually free time. For the whole course, I just spent 2 days before each exam and 1 night for each assignment(if you are not copying)More in-depth version of the DSE Chem syllabus and Atomic World in DSE Phy syllabus.

PowerPoints are not very appealing and not the clearest thing ever but its okay.Teaching is alright except the whole accent thing. He has a very hard time pronouncing English words so it makes it hard for students to listen to.

2 tutorials: scheduled before midterm and exam repectively. bacially review for exam (optional)hard to understand at first but u get use to his accent after the 1st few lectures
not bad a lecturer, ppt can be a bit messy but he explains well verbally
also he is very willing to answer question after lecture
he has lot of exercises in his ppt (mc)
tutorial is ok useful geh
1st tutorial covered most of the things that came up in exam
2nd tutorial only covered the bonding part. eft the rest to ourselvsThere are a total of 9 topics in this course.
1. Matter and Measurement
2. Chemical Foundations
3. Atomic Orbital
4. Chemical Bonding
5. VSEPR
6. Molecular Orbital
7. Balancing equations, molar mass, etc.
8. Thermodynamics
9. Ideal gas (And a little bit of real gas)

Most of the topics have been taught during your time in secondary school, so they are not so big of a deal.

However, pay attention to Atomic orbital and molecular orbital.
They are quite hard for someone who has never been exposed to quantum mechanics.Jia's teaching is actually not too bad if you set aside his most peculiar accent.
He is patient and more than willing to answer your questions after lectures.Chapter 1.   Introduction: Matter and Measurements
Chapter 2.   Chemical Foundations
Chapter 3.   Atomic Structure and Periodicity
Chapter 4.   Bonding: General Concepts
Chapter 5.   Molecular Geometry and Bonding Theories
Chapter 6.   Chemical Stoichiometry
Chapter 7.   Chemical reactions in aqueous solution
Chapter 8.   Thermochemistry: Chemical Energy
Chapter 9.   Gases

include both DSE chemistry and physics, and also more elaboration on itPoor presentation. just read according to the powerpoint.
prof. has small speaking volume and poor accentThe content includes:
1. Chemical Foundation
2. Atomic Structure and Periodicity
3. Atoms To Molecules
4. Bonding General Concepts
5. Molecular Structure and Bonding
6. Chemical Energy
But some of the content in his lecture note will not be tested in the exam, and content which tested in midterm will not be tested again in the final exam.It is quite boring as the professor just read out the ppt slides, but have lecture videos.
You can ask the question directly to the professor through canvas.High School Chemistry

Chapter 8.   Thermochemistry: Chemical Energy
Chapter 9.   GasesBoring.
He just reads the powerpoint slides and his english is not very good.
He does give some examples to help the students, but the explanations are short and are sometimes not enough.the content before the midterm is not similar to the high school one so have to work harder in it if you want a good grade almost all of them are new things and is hard to understand in a short period of time
and the content after the midterm half of it is similar to high school one (some of them are even easier than the dse one)I haven't attended all of the lectures but there are lecture videos in the canvas so it is easier for you to catch up the progress, however, I do not think the teaching is very good cause it does not help me a lot. I just learn more from the textbook and do the exercises in the textbook in order to get a better gradeAn extent from DSE curriculum and include many different topicsJust read the note and ask ta. lecture is a waste of time. the tone of the professor is too flat and with a heavy Chinese accent that can be merely understandquite good. u can get a fair grade if u study hard enoughhave two homework and two exams. the homework is a 4  pages word sheet and have about a week to finish.the content is doable if u understand the course.but the mean of the homework is very high because people copy each otherMainly high school Chemistry content, but more in-depth for some topics. Good as a foundational course. Some background knowledge in chemistry would be advantageous.Professor pretty much reads the powerpoint slides. Lecture notes and lecture videos are available online. However, the professor is very willing to stay after class to answer questions, which may be helpful for students."Orbitals" is the main and only part that is new to students, quite difficult, Khan Academy help a lot
Then other topics( VSEPR theory, enthalpy etc) are same as what we learnt in DSE levelNever go to class,
but i went to the review and tutorial sessions, quite good

prof mainly reads the ppt, videos are available onlineThis course is about some basics of atoms, ranging from old theories to modern atomic models.
The first chapter is easy and manageable if your chemistry grades were satisfactory in high school.
But things taught in chapter two will probably different from your perception of atoms and so you have to forget most of the things about atoms structure taught in high school before you study this chapter.
Things that taught in the chapters later are closely related to chapter 2 (e.g. molecular orbitals), so make sure you study chapter 2 well.
Overall, the amount of content taught is reasonable.Fair. Although professor talked in a lively way, but most of his words were just from the power point (and as the time for the class commence is 10:30 a.m., many students including me fell asleep), and before mid-term and final exams, he may or may not finish teaching the content covered in the exams. But if he cannot finish the things covered in the exams , he would still test you about the things he didn't talk about, just because "They're included in the reading assignments! Lectures are conducted to help you understand the things in the book." So please be careful.quite difficult content before midterm for orbital
others are dse things, not difficult content, but questions in exam is quite trickyprof ask us to rely on textbook and lecture is just for supplementary
and he is of mainland accent
sleepy lectures though I attended all
however, things are able to be all learnt onlineIt's quite interesting but quite hard to handle.
If you like Chemistry, you will like to study about it.
Some Physic concept is included, but you can overcome them easily.Quite boring because just read from ppt.
Early lecture and cannot choose other timeslotits not hard to get a B+ if you are already quite familiar with chemistry.
but IMO getting a A or above is hard as i can only get a A- even I have got about 84% total score, but people there are insane who pull the curve sky high. Anyway i am not a good example as i almost didn't attend any lectures at all, you may get a better result if you are hardworking enough.very low, only two assignments, you can get a full mark easily with a reliable source, but be exceptionally caution with the questions, they are all traps.Basically cover most of chemistry topic in HKDSE.
some new topic like orbital theory and bondingProf. has some difficulty of his spoken English. Some students would "appreciate"  his English by laughing. If you pay more attention, you still can get what he means. You can skip those lesson as he just follows and teach PPT directlyMatter and Measurement

The IA also prepared two tutorials before exam. You may find his teaching can let u catch up all the topics quicklyThe course focused on teaching fundamental chemistry knowledge.

Textbook: "Chemistry: An Atoms First Approach" Zumdahl and Zumdahl, 2016 Cengage Learning International Edition

It was not required to purchase.Prof Jia exerted himself in teaching this course. Yet, his pronunciation and intonation have large room for improvement. It is quite difficult to listen and follow.  Besides, he did attempt not to dictate the words that were typed on the PowerPoint but finally he failed to do so.

There were two tutorial lessons, before the mid-term exam and before the final exam, which were not compulsory. The IA extracted the main points and taught them again.

Both Prof Jia and IA are very helpful in deed. If you have any questions, you can ask them in class or via email. They will respond to questions within one to two days, or even shorter.The course is mostly about the orientations about the molecules and elements, which are the most difficult to understand in the whole course. Others like the boiling point stuff are the easy stuffs which are from the DSE syllabus. Students may find the orientation part seemingly difficult.The professor has bad english and stutters while talking, which made the teaching very difficult to understand. The lecturer also only give out the Powerpoints with answers before the exam, which made students who study normally to have a difficulty.Chapter 9_gases

some of the parts related to physical chemHis English is not good and that affects his teaching. You may watch the lecture videos or study the ppt by yourself to get a better understanding of the content.Mostly focused on structure of molecules and atoms
1. Chemical Foundation
2. Atomic Structure and Periodicity
3. Atoms To Molecules
4. Bonding General Concepts
5. Molecular Structure and Bonding
6. Chemical EnergyPersonally I frequently missed the class as he just reads off from the powerpoint and lecture videos are available on online website. Often his pronounciation was difficult to understand. Some useful examples tho. Textbook is not worth buying.The course content is mostly similar to the dse syllabus,eg acids and bases, calculations, balance of equations, gas law, etc. However, topics like quantum mechanics, valence bond theory, molecular orbitals may be new and more difficult.


2 Assignments, each worth five percent.
Mid-term exam ---> forty percent
Final exam ---> fifty percentquite boring, It is possible to get a good grade by watching all the lecture videos only.Half of the syllabus is already included in DSE. Just need to work on the another half. Some topics like atomic orbitals and molecular orbitals are somehow difficult.Fair. He usually read out the ppt word by word. You could just watch the lecture video if you don't want to wake up early for lessons. But the TA is quite good that he may help you with your assignments.quite important for chem-major student
not hard if you have friend can teach you
because jia dont know how to teachjia dont know how to teach
if you dont understand then ask your jobama
they understandFor a 2 credit course, there is a lot of content.The professor is definitely enthusiastic and passionate about chemistry, you'll see it in the first week. Even though his teaching is kind of boring, it's still very understandableIt is a course about physical chemistry.
If you take elective "atomic world" for HKDSE physics, the midterm content is almost 90% the same as what you have learnt before.
The content for final will not overlap those in midterm.Not quite good. Since it is a lecture, it is hard for you to ask questions during the lesson. The prof. usually skips things which he assumes you know and sometimes explains things very unclearly.
There is a tutorial session before both mid-term and final. it is more like a revision class than a teaching class. If you understand very few things before going to the tutorial, it is hard for you to learn in it. As it is a very short session and the tutor would only explain very briefly for each question.Professor may not have adequate explanation on some concepts. You may need to check for them online but still those concepts are easy to understand.
If someone have studied chemistry at HKDSE,they should find this course is quite easy.
There is also some topics which were covered in HKDSE.Lack of adequate explanation. I believe you should check the concepts online for deep understanding.Just as the course name suggests, it is a rather general course. Emphasis is placed on compensating what is missing in DSE chemistry i.e. understanding the physical aspect of chemical reaction (microscopic interactions such as bondings and energies and their manifestation at macroscopic level). The length of the content is moderate.I am a chemistry maniac but he made me skip lesson frequently. His lesson is simply not worth attending to be honest. He is that bad in terms of teaching. Also, he taught slowly and did not finish all the content required. However, he (and his TAs) is quite responsible (le.g. giving statistics of exams, organizing paper checking session etc.)Quite good, covers something basic and yet crucial to understanding the basis of advanced knowledge.Not good, I can hardly understand his english.
He teaches so fast and we can hardly catch up.
The teaching assistants are not that helpful.
Many questions asked are not well answered by the TAs.Jia is not a good english speaker but he really get well prepared for each lecture. His sound is so little and you'd better sit closer to hear what he's trying to say. He has so many exercises and examples in class to exemplify the theories and knowledge he teaches. If you can understand all the words he says, you can really get a very good grades! (I listened to his video for so many times @@)It is a 2-credit course but you need to study many things just like a 3-credit course. The topics include:
1. Chemical Foundation
2. Atomic Structure and Periodicity
3. Atoms To Molecules
4. Bonding General Concepts
5. Molecular Structure and Bonding
6. Chemical EnergySince he teaches too slow, he doesn't cover all the topics that CHEM1020 required. Hence, the final exam only covers up to the topics about chemical energy. His english is terrible. You may choose not to attend the lecture since it may be useless to you. Lecture notes are well designed. In midterm and final exam, you need to remember all details in the lecture notes in order that you can get a good grade.Atomic structure, orbitals and bonding theory, molecular geometry, gas laws, properties of solids and liquids, chemical kinetics. Really easy especially if you've self-studied HKAL Chem. It's essential to do the homework they put on LMES (Canvas in coming years?) though. Those are really helpful for understanding concepts and seeing if you're missing stuffs required for exams.Very slow and unclear teaching. Prof is too self-aware to essentially give you any damn. Also speaks too softly and too muffled. Not gonna take attendance so tbh no loss skipping lessons (especially if you have one or two friends who insist on attending all lessons). Also pronunciation -- abandon all hope of trying to understanding everything prof says. Siginificant figures and oshun (oxygen) are all you're gonna get.For spring, lecture only.
IF u want to listen prof 9 up, you should go to lecture. Sometime he will talk something deep, but it is not test in the course.HKALE chemistry, focus on orbital.
Easy to understand, and easy to remember.
You have to memorize something, but not much.Jia's English like shit.
But he will answer all of your questions after the lesson if you ask.above mean ~1.5SD in both MT and Final, A.MT Final assignments.
The assignments are easy, it helps you to revise for the content, and good for your exam.The class I liked most in the semester. The contents were totally not difficult if you attended all sessions. This also means that if you are going to miss something in the middle, then the sessions after will become hundred times more difficult. Luckily there are lecture videos. Just make sure you don't watch all the videos at the night before the exam.The professor teaches in a slow, easily understood manner. There are rarely 'key points' that someone must memorize to get good grades. The professor always include tons of good review / practical questions in his powerpoint and asks students in his lectures. No one ever answers him though. They were not difficult, and might be past paper questions, so actually they are useful. If you could answer most of the questions, then you really don't need to study for the exam. The TA is also very helpful in answering questions about both assignments and lecture materials. The learning atmosphere is good, we give a big hand to the professor after each lecture, and he appears to be happy.Before midterm: Molecular orbitals and VSEPR theory, which may be easy to handle if you have heard about orbitals before.
After midterm: Valence bond theory and molecular bond theory, which is new to local students. There is also some DSE chemistry stuff and gas laws, which is not too hard to understand.

If you are good enough in chemistry and have heard something about orbitals, you won't find this course very rewarding as you may not be able to learn a lot of things as this course is quite basic.Professor Jia does not speak with clear English, but he will go through his powerpoints quite carefully. Simply attending the lectures and a little bit revision should be enough to ace in the exams.Before mid-term:
Classification of matter, Elements and Periodic table, Measurements and significant figures, atoms, ions, molecules, compounds, Atomic spectra and the Bohr model, Quantum mechanical model(Wave-particle duality, Quantum numbers, energy and shapes of atomic orbitals, polyelectronic atoms), Periodic trends in atomic properties, Ionic bonding, Covalent bonding, Lewis Structures(Resonance, Formal Charges), VSEPR

After mid-term:
Valence Bond Theory and hybridization, Molecular Orbital Theory, Chemical stiochiometry, Reactions in aqueous solutions(Properties, precipitation, acid-base, redox), Chemical energy(1st law of thermodynamics, enthalpy, Hess' Law), Gases(Properties, gas laws, Kinetic Molecular Theory, Ideal and real gases)

More than half of the course are used to teach Bohr model, Quantum mechanical model, Lewis Structures, VSEPR Theory, Valence Bond Theory and Molecular Orbital Theory. They are the most important content in this course(and in Chemistry).never attend lecture so i didn't know how his teaching but i know lecture video is provided.Chapter 1.   Introduction: Matter and Measurements
Chapter 2.   Chemical Foundations
Chapter 6.   Chemical Stoichiometry
Chapter 7.    Chemical reactions in aqueous solution
Chapter 8.    Thermochemistry: Chemical Energy
----For above topics, most parts are included in DSE-------
----For below topics, only some parts are included in DSE------
Chapter 3.   Atomic Structure and Periodicity (some parts are included in DSE Physics Atomic World)
Chapter 4.   Bonding: General Concepts
Chapter 5.   Molecular Geometry and Bonding Theories
Chapter 9.   Gases (most parts are included in DSE Physics Heat)Although JIA's accent is very special, he is nice to answer our questions. There are exercises and review questions to consolidate the new concepts just taught. TA(Tsz kiu) is also helpful.

Homework and sample mid-term and final are provided so there are sufficient exercises.

Lecture video will be provided.This course teaches you about modern concepts of atoms. Before the midterm it teaches you 5 notable atomic models and require you to know the details of each model. The main content is about the quantum mechanical model of atom which is quite different from what I have learnt in high school. The professor kept strengthening the importance of atomic orbital and clarifying the most confusing part. After the midterm we were taught about Molecular orbital which is similar to atomic orbital. However, if you didn't learn the AO part well you are gonna suffer from MO and keep snowballing, so please revise and learn AO thoroughly.Mainland Professor, pronunciation could be improved. Thought he spoke too bad at the beginning, after attending chem1030 lecture, I think he speaks quite well already. He speaks with passion and motivation, but still sleepy because it is 10am lesson.
Told you to read the textbook and learn the content yourself, didn't really read that much but learn the course material by reading ppts. If you have any questions please ask the IA, he is quite helpful, friendly and could answer most of your questions.
Don't expect the professor will feed you like your teachers in high school, self learning is the key.Content is very very very disorganized. Little relationship found among different topics. Concepts not explained clearly. Things get messy starting from chapter 3. Be prepared to understand the philosophy of one single electron using several lectures. The molecular orbital thingy in chapter 5 is also hard as hell.

Main topics
Briefly introduced/reviewed topicsJia's accent is among the most memorable in HKUST cuz it's tooooooo awful! I still remember how he pronounced "significant figures" as "siganigaficant figgers...." and "wave function" as "wharf funkshion".

WTF!!! Why are the mainland students here??? They already know all the contents!!! They're just here to dwarf you, make you look stupid, and push towards the inevitable inferiority complex!!!

In every lecture mainland students all sit in the front rows, actively answering all the questions Jia raised. Other students are either sitting at the back sleeping, or just skip all the lectures cuz the lectures are simply useless as fuck.

On the other hands, the TA was very helpful and he was more able to explain all the concepts. So every time I slept in the lecture, and after that I just asked the TA what Jia was fucking murmuring about. My beloved Prof Jia Jia, don't u fucking feel ashamed when the TA gets sooooooo popular after the lecture while the prof just stands asides and watches the TA surrounded by the crowd of confused students asking questions? The TA SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE PROFESSOR instead. I give a D, not an E, just because of the TA.First half of the course (before the midterm): Lewis structure, atomic orbitals, VSEPR theory
Second half: hybridization, molecular orbitals, thermochemistry (mostly calculations), gases, liquids & solids.

This course was, in my opinion, mainly a course of memorisation, not understanding.

It did cover a very wide range of topics, but I just didn't find them interesting or useful (note: I'm NOT at all interested in chemistry).He just read out the lecture slides *with a rather strong accent*The content is more or less the same as the DSE syllabus, with an addition of some knowledge on crystals and molecule orbitals, basically it is easy to handle.Jia's English is hard to understand because of his unique accent, however it doesn't hinder the understanding on the course, because he gives a lot of examples and lecture notes provided are comprehensive. Furthermore, there will be tutorial sessions before mid term and final, review questions are of the same type as those appeared in the final. Overall, it is easy to prepare the exam.Introduction to Quantum Theory, wave-functions, quantum theory of motion, vibration, rotation.
Hydrogen physics, atomic/molecular systems and structures and spin.
Solving the hydrogen/hydrogenic Schrodinger's equation to obtain the orbital structure/energy/angular momentum, etc.
Molecular orbital, the variational principle and Huckel theory.

Overall not too hard stuff but with lots of physics concepts and some maths included.

My opinion is that it is not detailed enough about the content on spin.

Textbook: Atkins Physical Chemistry 10th EditionProfessor Huang's teaching is quite interesting and he gives the explanation of the key concepts in a very detailed way. Though not every time the students can understand but at least I know he is trying his best to explain and teach us.
One time he uses a simile of the Pokemon Go game to explain the relationship with eigen-function and eigen-values. This is a quite interesting part.
After first few lectures, he spent half of the class period distributing a questionnaire to let us list the pros and cons of his way of teaching to make improvement and that was an impressive lecture. He also let us vote for the date for the date of the midterm exam and so the atmosphere was quite relaxed and free.
He sometimes asked some simple questions in class to review the previous class and invited some volunteer to answer him or write the math/calculation on the whiteboard.

Overall his lectures were quite easy to understand and his way of teaching was detailed and interesting.Book: Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics,Structure and Change(Tenth Edition)
This course covers:
Topic 1.Introduction to Quantum Theory (Chapter 7);
Topic 2.The Quantum Theory of Motion (Chapter 8);
Topic 3.Atomic Systems (Chapter 9);
Topic 4.Molecular Structure (Chapter 10).
This course includes the Schrödinger equation, so it contains a lot of knowledge about Mathematics.
(Math 1014: Chapter 7,11.10, 12.2, 12.3~12.4, 14.3, 14.5, 15;
Math 2011: Chapter 1.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.8, 4.3;
Math 2351: First order equations, Second order equations, Separation of variables.)Professor made a questionnaire after assignment 1 to let us list the advantages and disadvantages of teaching, and professor changed according to the disadvantages.
The lecture was interesting and easily understood. Professor gave a lot of examples to explain some difficult theories, like use Pokemon GO to explain eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. There may be one or two questions in the class, the professor will give about 3 minutes to ask volunteer to write the answer process.The course is apt the basic concept of general chemistry. Mainly about the characteristics of elements or chemistry people will usually get in touch with in their daily lives.Teaching is good. Professor is quite funny, which makes lectures less boring. the explanation on different concepts of chemistry is adequate.The teaching materials are interesting as well as related to everyday life. There are some exciting experiments carried out in lectures, and sometimes he plays interesting TV shows to teach and entertain at the same time.
Chapter 1:What is everything made of?
Chapter 2:The Air.
Chapter 3: The air and our environment.
Chapter 4: The metals inour daily life.
Chapter 5:Metals in the industry.
Chapter 6:Fire and fuels.The teaching is great.
He's always helpful and the lectures are not very boring. If you skip the lectures, you might miss a wonderful experiment. He gives the projects proper attention and help so that the project can be done without much difficulty.Overall, the course is very easy, especially for mainland students who have background in chemistry. The course taught a lot of topics, and you need to memorize a lot of stuffs (e.g. usage of aromatic....
Also, in the final exam, the prof tested mainly on battery chapter.(didnt attend most of themThe course talks about some basic chemistry knowledge and fundamental chemistry problem solving skills, and half of this course is about reciting.I can not figure out what would be included in the exam when I was attending the class. Therefore I was so confuse when revising the course. It is so bad that I cant get any point in the class.basic dse chem
not really good if you have never studied chem during your high school years

6 chapters in total
Chp.1 Atoms
Chp.2 Air
Chp.3 Air and Environment
Chp.4 Metals
Chp.5 Metals in the industry
Chp.6 Fire and fuelsprof is funnyCover dse chem summary, from what is atom, compose of air, metal and non-metal, simple organic chemistry and fire.Dr Chan is really funny, and he always does experiments in the class so you won't feel boring.
During the project, each group would be assigned with a TA, however, most TAs are not reliable, and some of them may even just ignore you or say something useless, e.g. "You can know that in the experiment." And you are going to end up with asking Dr. Chan.The basic Chemistry, the content is less than the whole DSE syllabus but still a bit chur if you never study Chemistry before.
There are 6 chapters in total.
Chp.1 Atoms
Chp.2 Air
Chp.3 Air and Environment
Chp.4 Metals
Chp.5 Metals in the industry
Chp.6 Fire and fuelsHe is so nice and willing to give a lot of comments on our project and always answer our questions.
There are experiments which are very exciting especially is the one about Halloween.
Suggest that don't miss any lessons although there are lecture videos.BE CAREFUL
ALL DSE CHEM STUFF
I personally haven't studied anything related to chem before
BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE TAKING THIS COURSE STUDIED CHEM BEFORE SO THEY CAN GET REALLY GOOD GRADES
tons of stuff to learn, but they are not very difficult
you will feel like you are really learning something interesting when you are revising (if you like learning new things)Jason is very cute and I think that he teaches well. However the lectures were still a bit boring to me, so I didn't attend the lectures after attending several. there are lecture videosIt is basically about our life and there are really some contents you have to memorize very well. The most interest part are the experiments.There are explosions sometimes and it is really thrilling to seat in the front rows.
The contents are as follows:
chemistry in everyday life
the air
pollutions
metal
ore
fire
I think you will find it instructive if you are interested in it initiallyThe professor 's English is very good and he is really nice and patient. He is very responsible and recorded and uploaded the video of every lecture after it.It is the most basic chemistry. If you have learned chemistry in high school, this course would be very easy to you. As for those who haven't studied chemistry before, you may need to pay more effort.
Chapter 1 What is everything made of
Chapter 2 Air
Chapter 3 The air and our environment
Chapter 4 The metals in our everyday life
Chapter 5  Metals in the industry
Chapter 6  Fire and fuelsThe professor is friendly. In the class, he would perform some interesting chemistry experiment.This course mainly focuses on the basic concepts of chemistry. Many of them are covered in DSE syllabus, so it's relatively easy for those dropped chem in secondary school.

The following chapters are included:
Chapter 1:What is everything made of?
Chapter 2:The Air.
Chapter 3: The air and our environment.
Chapter 4: The metals in our daily life.
Chapter 5:Metals in the industry.
Chapter 6:Fire and fuels.
Chapter 7*:Food, Drinksand medicine
(*Will be taught if schedule is allowed)Dr. Chan is a local instructor and he can carry out the lectures in fluent English. He loves to demonstrate experiments during classes, especially in some occasions like halloween. Those interesting demonstration can explain the chemical mechanism in a simpler way, that even the students with no chemistry background can still understand well.This course is for the student who did not take DSE chem course or only attend 0.5X in secondary school. The lesson started with the basic chemistry knowledge, covering 7 chapter.DSE Chemistry
Chapter 1:What is everything made of?Chapter 2:The Air.Chapter 3: The air and our environment.Chapter 4: The metals in our daily life.Chapter 5:Metals in the industry.Chapter 6:Fire and fuels.Chapter 7:Materials of the world.Professor do experiements during the lecture, which make the lecture more fun.If you have studied DSE chem, you can handle the course easily.
It is about ocean, rock, air...
similar to DSE
Mainly about the  elements or chemistry we usually get in touch in lifeBad
if you want to learn well,
don't need to go to the lecture
different concepts of chemistry is adequate.It's about daily life's science. You can do your own project about what you interest in. It's really free.The basic ideas and principles of chemistry will be explained through many examples of everyday life. The course will focus on developing a chemical understanding of the materials and processes that surround us in the world. Many relevant topics will be discussed such as the air, air pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, metals and their uses, minerals and gems, fire and fuels, color and light, food and drinks, household chemical products, polymers and drugs.The professor is really fun. He gave us candy in Halloween and gave us a show at that day.It is all about the basic knowledge of chemistry. The content is not difficult but you have to attend the lecture in order to understand the concepts. If you have studied chemistry in high school (but did not attend the dse exam), it will be easy to understand the lecture.The professor is so good as he will always demonstrate different experiments and he will explain the concept very detailedly. If you have any questions, he will answer you very patiently and he is a very nice guy!There is quite a lot of content as this course is actually suggested for people without any chemistry background. But if you do not have ANY chemistry background I do not recommend you to take it as there is quite a lot of content and not enough time to go through it all. As an IB student chemistry SL, this was still quite toughOur teacher as fantastic, always doing crazy things in class like experiments. He was quite thorough with the teaching and I actually enjoyed these lectures unlike other boring lectures by boring professors.From the very early times, people always desired to understand what the world is made up of, what is the nature of the materials that make up the world and the universe, why the materials behave the way they do.

We interact with many different materials every day: some are liquid while some are solid or gases; some of them are colourful while some are colourless; some may give out light; some may burn and give a flame; some are soft, some are hard; then some are living things, including ourselves, and some materials although are lifeless, but seems to have a mind of its own such as computers. There are so many natural and man-made phenomenon and situations that we encounter everyday which drive our curiosity, and in Chemistry we focus our understanding on the nature of matter and how and why matter behave the way that do.He is an amazing professor, very engaging. The lab sessions is however not taught by him - not that engaging or interesting. It's very hard to follow through labs.Content is simple and clear. It is informative for those who didn't have chemistry background, KK Jason will consolidate your science knowledge no doubt.His lecture is interesting. Not only he does exciting experiment every week, but he is also showing some video which made by himself, it means sometime he will teach chemistry by broadcasting the video. His teaching will never be boring. Apart from the entertainment, you will learn chemistry in a simple and easy way, because KK Jason may introduce his own memorization method for students to remember better. So far, KK Jason is the best professor i have ever seen in HKUST.I think the content is quite a lot ,also the range is quite wide.But it is not difficult to catch up,if you attend his lesson enough.
And the project is quite funny,to do some interesting experment and write the report.
There is  seven chapter
Chapter 1: What is everything made of?
Chapter 2: The Air. Chapter 3:  The air and our environment. Chapter 4:  The metals in our daily life. Chapter 5: Metals in the industry. Chapter 6: Fire and fuels. Chapter 7*: Food, Drinks and medicine. *depending on the progress of the courseCHAN TEACH QUITE WELL,HE ALWAYS DO THE EXPERIMENT ,YOU WONT BE BORING
He is the good lecturer, he will answer my question seriously.Also ,he is humorous person,he always talk a joke during the lesson.The content is quite broad as well as deep. Covers quite a few chapters (if I recall correctly, 5), so there is a lot to learn.The teacher is average. The teacher offers demonstrations that make the lectures more interesting. (He has a good sense of humor, too.)The grading is (mostly) fair, although it should be noted that the teacher won't spend too much time looking at your assignments. This is fine, as the number of students taking the course probably goes by the hundreds, but in my opinion this cost me a mark or two due to this superficiality. Otherwise the grading is okay.There is one (long) assignment (which you can choose what assignment you want to do) and an exam, so the workload is just about right.The content was quite broad:

Chapter 1: What is everything made of? (Matters, atoms and their structure, arrangement, and their discoveries, elements, atoms counting)
Chapter 2: The air. (Covalent bonding, molecules and compounds, intermolecular forces, electronegativity and bond polarity, strength of bonds)
Chapter 3: The air and our environment. (Explanation on the process of global warming and ozone layer depletion, acid and bases)
Chapter 4: The metals in our daily life. (Properties of metals, metallic bond, alloys, ionic bonding, reaction of metals with oxygen, water, and acids)
Chapter 5: Metals in the industry. (Redox reactions, metal displacement reactions and their related topics: principles of metal extractions, electroplating, and batteries)
Chapter 6: Fire and fuels. (Fire, fire distinguishers, fuels, alkane, fireworks, explosives)The lectures moved quickly, but with interesting demonstrations. (in this semester a Halloween Trick or Treat demonstration was given!)6 Chapters for the whole course. There is an additional chapter for the course in case there is any time left.
Chapter 1: What is everything made of?
Chapter 2: The Air.
Chapter 3:  The air and our environment.
Chapter 4:  The metals in our daily life.
Chapter 5: Metals in the industry.
Chapter 6: Fire and fuels.The lecture was not boring, almost every lecture will have some experiments to show. Also, sometimes he will show some videos, making the lecture has more fun.mainly what we have learned in high school like metal, pollution,atom and fire.it's quite interesting for there are some experiments and funny videos to watch.it's not hard to get a good grade unless you make effort. the final is a little bit difficult because it require you not only to remember the content but also use it in different kinds of situation in daily life.2 quizes, 1 project (no midterm instead), final, not very much but still require enough time to review and do experiment.Very basic knowledge about chemistry. I came from mainland and 90% is coverd in our high school  lessons. It's basically about learning the English version of our high school chemistry. A little bit new things and really easy to understand.
If from mainland, a good choice to spend the first semester studying this course to fit in university life.The professor is really nice always fun and inspiring. He explained many difficult theories in easy ways. Although many students chose to not to listen to him in class, he is not bored and always tried to catch your attention by intersting experiments,shows, and videos.
You will be invited to his office to discuss about the project. His office is really fun. Many commic books about chemistry and very precious model of different substance.Mainly DSE content plus some additional info
6 lecture notes
every lesson one ppt
Many people drop CHEM in DSE
would be difficult if you didnt study chem before
coz the content is quite a lot (3 years thing in 1 semester)
better do not take this course if u didnt study chem beforeThe content of this course seems like the majority part in dse chem.
The course is divided into seven Chapters:
Chapter 1: What is everything made of?
Chapter 2: The Air.
Chapter 3:  The air and our environment.
Chapter 4:  The metals in our daily life.
Chapter 5: Metals in the industry.
Chapter 6: Fire and fuels.
Chapter 7*: Food, Drinks and medicine.
*depending on the progress of the course (but usually won't have time to cover in lecture)Jason's teaching is very interesting. it is never boring to attend his lesson. Sometimes, there are always experiments and video watched during lesson.If you are not familiar with chemistry in HKDSE, this course will be hard to follow. It basically teaches the three year HKDSE chemistry in one semester. The first two chapters are easy to follow. But starting from chapter three(totally six chapters will be taught in one semester), if you don't have a solid base in chemistry, it will become extremely difficult. I still find it hard to follow even I study two years of chemistry in secondary school(I dropped it in the third year).Jason is fun and willing to reply to students. There are also some experiments in the lecture which are eye-catching. He makes the lessons have more fun than I expected.The content of this course is really comprehensive. It includes nearly all aspects of basic chemistry, from inorganic chemistry to organic chemistry, from principles to properties, from micro to macro, from theories to experiments. You will really learn a lot if you attend every class and work hard, though it may not always be the case for most of us.Jason is really an interesting guy. He teaches with great patience and he will patiently answer your questions after class. There will always be some surprise in his class, for he sometimes bring you fascinating chemistry experiments.easy, dse syllabus , jason always do experiment. the lecture notes are too long , but the powerpoint is too brief
so you had better read the lecture notes yourself and make your own notes. the notes you need to read is quite longgood, jason is good at teaching. he always do lots of experiments and explain the notes in a good way. he is a good lecturer and patient man.Lots of fun experiment in almost each lecture
Drama videos related ChemistryVery well organised. Mostly consists of high school chemistry. No difficulty to understand even as a complete newbie to chemistry. The 6 chapters were:
1. What is everything made of?
2. Air
3. The air and our environment
4. The metals in our daily life
5. Metals in industry
6. Fire and fuelsLots of experiments during lectures, even a set of Halloween-themed experiments on the last lecture before 31st Oct. Clearly Dr Chan was well-prepared, always tried to grab our attention. And replied emails very quickly. Lecture notes were very clear and concise,Well, I would have to say that the content was partially new to me. True, some contents did overlap with those that I learned as a high school student, but the contents got more and more challenging as we finished up chapter 1,2,3 and 4.

Don't worry, it is definitely not difficult to understand the chemistry concept handled by this course, thats for sure if you make a certain degree of effort. However, what you should worry is that the approach of this chemistry course is hugely different with probably most of the chemistry courses - it is really about chemistry 'in everyday life'.  More than understanding the concepts, you should have a tight grip on the everyday usage of certain reactions, chemicals and manufacturing process if you want to do well in this course.I whined about the contents, but this professor is just absolutely fantastic. He performs a lot of interesting experiments, dragging us closer to the course. He is also very willing to answer individual questions after each lecture, and he does so in a very cordial manner.Rich content!
For non science students, I believe the content of the course is quite boring.
Basically it's the full syllabus of HKDSE chemistry but just you're studying it in one semester.
Do not try to revise right before final exam like me or else you'll find it very difficultProfessor Chan is humorous and he made a lot of effort to arouse students' interest in chemistry. He always prepared a lot of experiments to demonstrate in front of us during lectures. PowerPoint is welly designed, notes are easy to follow.most of the time its easy and was already covered in high schoolthe teaching is interesting. You can appreciate beautiful chemical reaction experiment on every coursebe careful with the quizzes! (There are two online quizzes)
Especially the units!!!! Also, you cannot return to previous questions once you press 'next'

It's better to take the online quizzes after most of your friends takes them xD (Some answers will be available after submitted)very low, no midterm, only a group project ( you can also choose individual project), two online quizzes, and finalThis course is prepared for students who haven't learned chem before. Since you have to pick up the whole content which supposed to be taught in high school so the course will not go through all the topic one by one. But it is easy to catch up if you attend the lectures.the instructor always does lots of experiment during the lecture and made it more interesting and easily to understand good teaching styleBasic chemistry knowledge
Chapter 1: What is everything made of?
Chapter 2: The Air.
Chapter 3: The air and our environment.
Chapter 4: The metals in our daily life.
Chapter 5: Metals in the industry.
Chapter 6: Fire and fuels.
Chapter 7: Materials of the world.He would prepare ppt in each lecture to talk about the content in notes. He also included some videos to help you understand. Dr Chan is quite nice and you can feel free to ask questions.It is a fundamental course for students who did not study any chemistry course in high school. However, many students who had previously study in chemistry but dropped out before HKDSE would also enrol in this course, which might increase the mean score. The content is basically high school content up to electrical chemistry and some organic chemistry. Students who are not previously studying in chemistry before would find these quite difficult to understand since the pace of the class is quite fast.

The handouts is comprehensive and design just like a secondary school textbook. Lecture slides with notes would upload to Canvas and students who do not go to class can also get answers.It is some basic Chemistry stuff.
In the later part of the course, some topics are quite hard which touch on some organic chemistry.The prof is quite nice and he opens to questions. He explained the concept quite well.

I only attend two classes though. As it was a 9 am lecture and he provided lecture video which he will upload by the next day, so you can just simply skip the lectures.Rich content. Ensure that you read up on the provided materials and understand the underlying concepts.Interesting as experiements were shown during lecture. He goes through the lecture materials in class based on the notes provided. He also looks into students queries when in doubt. Make sure you do enough eg. Homework given in notes, that would help you prepare for class.Content Sticks true to the course name
Though there can be some part which can be a little difficult for someone with no chemistry background.
If you learnt CHEM in highschool than it should be no problem.
No video recording but If you have solid CHEM background than you can skip the LEC
but he does leave some part of the lec notes blank ( fills it during lec) so you might want a diligent friend for that partInstructor is really good, good pronunciation and clear and concise
does a few experiment from time to time you can anticipate interesting experiments at least once a week.
His teaching is also well paced so you should have no problem following his LEC.some fundamental chemistry knowledge but with a very wide coverage.
Content in the notes sometimes seems like common sense to you, however, pay extra attention to those details in the notes. Since MC questions constitute a considerable parts of the final exam, and usually have very miscellaneous points.very clear and you would see some interesting experiments during the lectureit is about the basic chemistry.
i have studied part of the DSE chemistry and dropped it but still find the course materials are too much.
if you haven't studied chem before, i think you have to attend the lectures to understand the concepts.
for those who have studied DSE chemistry before and dropped it want to get good grade in this course, don't have this idea, because your project contributes 40% of the course and you cannot control the marks of the project, like my case. i did well in final but did poorly the project.i skipped most of his lessons so i have no comments.

and i don't know the requirements of the project even i follow his guidelines and attend the lecture that he explained how to do the project

The marking guidelines of the project are unclear.Basically high school chemistry with more in depth and extra topics. Quite hard for non-chemistry background student.  If skipped some lectures, hard to catch up on by yourself.The professor is great, make a lot of jokes and likes to do experiment to keep things interesting. Easy to approach, but sometimes likes to refer to things in cantonese.the professor is nice but the course is difficult for non-science students in secondary school. didnt attend lectures and self-learning is difficult cause topics like polymers are extremely hard for fool like me.good professor. you can always come and ask him questions. he is willing to help and always smiles.- Atom
- Atomic structure
- Chemical bonds
- Gases, Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces
- Acids and Bases
- Oxidation and Reduction
- Organic ChemistryIts content is similar to what was being taught in HKDSE syllabus. Including:
- history of chemistry
- elements
- metals
- bonding
- orbital
- acid & base
- basic organic chemistry
Redox reaction. Not difficult to learn at all even if you are a newbie in chemistry. [for student with no chemistry background only]Prof. Huang's lectures were clear enough in elaborating concepts in the syllabus. The only thing to complain is his accent. He had a heavy Chinese accent which might be difficult for some students to understand.Basic Chemistry.
history of chemistry, elements, metals, bonding, orbital, acid & base, redox, polymerQuite simple if you have done chemistry before but I think you will struggle if you have not so consider that if you are thinking of taking this courseQuite good teaching quality but you have to like chemistry a little bit if you want to be interestedShould be able to pass really, maybe you will need a good chemistry back ground if you are going to do very well in this course.Pretty fair, just work hard, and you will be rewarded with a decent grade.Advanced organic chemistry knowledge about benzene ring, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acid derivatives, enols and enolates and amines.
The such knowledge including characteristics of such functional group, synthesis of organic compounds and the mechanism about nucleophilic and electrophilic reaction.The notes is enough but you need to group the information about the similar mechanism to understand the reaction.
I just take the first lesson and I think the professor is not good at English? So, I skip all the lesson after that.Going to some high environmental value place.
eg. Mai Po Nature Reserve, Fung Yuen Butterfly Reserve, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic GardenNot many Teaching from the instructor.
Mostly from the staff in the corresponding place.Pass or Fail.
If you don't escape lessons and take all the attendance.
Hand in the report before the deadline, an easy pass will be rewardedThe workload is just to attend the lesson on time.
The lesson must start very early (about 8AM)
If you escape lesson once, you will be in big trouble.
4 place is needed to be described in your report.
1000 words in total.
very easy job.Fun field trips in different HK valuable sites.
Students can enter some restricted areas in Maipo or Kadoorie Farm.
Free transportation and send you back to UST right after fun field trip.Do not expect much teaching from the instructors. The tour guide will be the one teaching and answering your questions.Field Trip (1): Coastal Marine Lab, HKUST
Field Trip (2): Air Monitoring Station, HKUST
Field Trip (3): SENT Landfill
Field Trip (4): Fung Yuen Butterfly Reserve
Field Trip (5): Kadoorie Farm & Botanic Garden
Field Trip (6): Mai Po Nature Reserve
Workshop (1): CV Writing
Field Trip (7): Voluntary Service at HK Wetland Park
Workshop (2): Interview SkillsCourse content is very interesting and informative. Topics include:
Ocean Exploration, Water budget, Plate tectonic, Ocean basins and ocean sediments, Hydrothermal vents and vent chemistry, Air-sea interactions, Ocean Currents
Surface circulation, Physical properties of seawater, Field Methods in oceanography, Waves and Tides, Coastal processes, Ocean chemistry, Introduction to phtyoplankton and spring bloom, Introduction to zooplankton, Introduction to marine bacteria and virus, Biogeochemical cycle, Ocean and human activities, Ocean and human health, Ocean and climate change

Basically the course provides an introduction to all the aspects of ocean science: physical, chemical, and biological.

There is a field trip included which is really fun and you get a chance to actually try out all the experiments and instruments you learn about on an actual boat in the bay.Karen is an excellent teacher. She is very passionate about the subject and always shares information from her own work and research.
Her teaching is very clear and easy to follow during lectures. She is always open to questions and ready to help with any problems.
She arranged 2 guest lectures via video link with her associates from different universities which were very informative and useful.
One of the best teachers I have had, and she really gets you interested in the subject.This course actually covers quite a lot of things from different fields, including microorganisms, biogeochemistry, waves and ocean structures. But some of them overlaps with LIFS3130 marine biology a bit.Karen is very passionate in teaching and helpful that welcomes you going to her office for questions. She really tries very hard to help us learn! The best teacher in UST for me!:)
Liu knows a lot but he always puts a lot of words into ppt slides and then reads them out in the class so it is quite boring while listening to his "reading aloud" in the lesson.Plant hormone, structure... (easy if you study lifs2080 plant bio)
Lab work is easy especially with good groupmates. Plants are quite interesting. One lab requires you to touch the plant for a period of time. FUN, then analyse the result by T-test in excel, would be explained by TA during lesson.Good and clear teaching from Melody. TAs are also helpful during lab if there are any questions. They all welcome you to ask questions. Usually won't minus your marks unlike other labs. Atmosphere is relaxing when comparing to other general labs.It follows the topic on LIFS2080 Plant Biology but follows on plant anatomy, i.e. plant structure, hormones, etc.

In case you have no idea how to study for final exam, there is a review session which tells you all you need to prepare for the exam.Melody is very friendly. She will answer all your questions patiently. You can be late 15 minutes and forgot to bring your lab coat and she still wouldn't punish you for it.Very interesting class. Actually it was my first class that was not held in lecture theater, so for me it was relatively small group. Each professor chooses two scientists that they love and lecture about their major scientific finding.Prof. Tye

She is a visiting professor. Very passionate and loving. Her part was about DNA sequencing and telomere. Both contents were interesting and I think her part was the part that I understood the most.

Prof. Mak
His accent is very gentle. He taught us about PC synthesis and biological clock. Actually this was a new course so the system was not solidified, and he was the first prof to deliver the lecture, so I think he overestimated our level.... It was hard to follow him. Still, his teaching was really nice.

Prof. Banfield
He was very humorous (though quite a lot of them are black humors). Some people said his speech is too fast, but I think understanding was not the problem, just hard to do note taking because of the speed.  He likes to jump to other topics all in sudden. So when he is lecturing, I get what he wants to tell us, but when I revise, I find some of my notes are totally unrelated to the topics and I do not even know why this topic is in my notes.This course is divided into 6 modules
1) Eugene Kennedy - Fat synthesis
2) Fred Sangher - Protein and DNA sequencing.
3) George Palade - Secretion and Membrane Trafficking.
4) Elizabeth Blackburn - Structure of chromosomes ( telomere)
5) Seymour Benzer - Biological Clocks.
6) Paul Nurse - The mechanics of Cell Cycle.

Each module is woven around a Nobel Laureate and one of his/.her biggest discoveries. Through their life history, students are introduced to the world of scientists, their discoveries, experimental techniques and the approach to designing experiments.

While the lives of the scientists is the theme of each module, historical details were barely tested in the exam. ( with the exception of one cheeky question, worth half a point XD).

  Emphasis is laid on understanding the rationale behind their experiments, ability to design simple experiments (involves understanding and application of experimental techniques)
and the concepts involved in their discoveries.

All in all, the content was interesting and inspiring. The approach adopted in this course succeeded in presenting the flavors of science - curiosity, imagination and experimental design.This course is taught by 3 professors. Each professor handles 2 modules.
1) Prof Mak:
He is very systematic in his presentation of information. His slides are comprehensive and have all the information required. He is eloquent and succinct in his delivery. All in all, he is a good lecturer. He was the most effective lecturer, with regard to remembering content. At the end of his class, you will remember the main points clearly.  

2) Prof Tye:
Very passionate about her subject.  Her lectures were interesting and very interactive, especially the tutorial sessions. the lecture notes were comprehensive as well. But she did not explain some concepts clearly, so make sure you clarify your understanding with the professor after or during class.  

3) Prof Banfield:
Very humorous and interesting lectures. His classes were both enjoyable and informative. Eloquent in delivery but  deviates often ( his side stories are interesting and funny),so one may lost track of the point being conveyed. He emphasizes the important points repeatedly, in a subtle ( not explicit) way, so if you pay attention, you will know what concepts to focus on for the exam. His lecture notes are comprehensive, but they had a lot of questions, without the answers. The answers were discussed in class. So if one does not attend lecture, they will face difficulty with those questions.  Points for the tutorial solution are also subtly discussed in class prior to submission of the tutorial assignment.

I strongly recommend attending class, as the finals tested students more on their conceptual understanding. It included some questions that required designing simple experiments.  Context to some slides ( why the professor included them in the lecture) and  answers to questions in the lecture notes will be provided in class. ( otherwise, one may wonder " what was the purpose of this slide? Seems random....") Points for the tutorial assessment will also subtly be hinted  in class, prior to assessment submission.Content very interesting and covers a lot of milestone research in the field of Biochemistry. Some are not straight forward and requires some thinking. I personally found the lecture videos very helpful, but I only used them for revision purpose. Go to class, not just for the sake of attendance but also because you get a much better understanding, lecture videos only helps then because it refreshes your memory.I think all the professors did a great job in teaching, although I will give special credits for Professor Banfield for the chocolate that he generously offered to anyone who answered his questions in his tutorials.The course structure is a little bit confusing - basically each professor teaches 2 modules (each revolves around a Scientist and a field of life science), each corresponds to 30 minutes of testing in the exam. These modules have three lecture teaching classes and one discussion tutorial class (the interactiveness depends on the professor).

Each student in the class is randomly allocated to one module to answer an essay question (1 A4 page, font 12, single spacing, not too long) when that module starts (the essay question is released on the first day of that module) and you have to finish the essay before the tutorial class, and basically the professor MAY call on these students to talk about their findings in the tutorial. Everyone can see the modules' question but only the designated students can submit it.

The 6 modules taught in my semester (in chronological order) were:
- Module 1 - Seymour Benzer - Circadian rhythm and animal studies on flies and mice (Mak)
- Module 2 - Fred Sanger - DNA and protein sequencing (Tye)
- Module 3 - Elizabeth Blackburn - Telomeres (Tye)
- Module 4 - Eugene Kennedy - Phosphatidyl synthesis pathway (Mak)
- Module 5 - George Palade - Centrifugation, EM and pulse chase technology, and organelles (particularly ribosomes) (Banfield)
- Module 6 - Paul Nurse - budding yeast, temperature sensitive mutations and the cell cycle and autophagy (Banfield)  

Each module was very insighftul - you are introduced to the tools and methods in the field, and then how this Scientists worked and collaborated, afterwards you learn the subsequent work in the field and the new technologies used now. In my semester, the order of the modules really seem as if it is flowing in increasing difficulty (beginning was so much easier than the end).

Apart from the modules, you need to write a 1 A4 page biography on one Scientists (they provide a list of 9 you choose 1) - you mainly have to discuss their method of discovery and the context of their research.I feel like the three professors teaching, tutorial question and exam question follows a spectrum from fixed, straightforward and predictable to most outgoing, casual and unpredictable (you will totally understand what I mean when you take this course). But all in all each style still works very well and provides new learning experiences.  

Tye:
Most straightforward and predictable out of the three. Her modules had very clear learning outcomes, easy to flow and follow through. Her exam questions are very predictable exactly the techniques, skills and knowledge she taught in class. Her tutorial questions are the easiest (thank god I was allocated to one of hers) because the answers can be easily googled and tend to be theory based, and these questions don't usually involve personal input it is mainly finding the right info. She tries to make her tutorial quite interactive by calling out 2-3 students allocated to her tutorial to talk in front of the class. Almost everyone did very well in her exam questions and her tutorial questions were almost all full or near full marks.

Mak:
His style is somewhere in between the other two professors - his content is quite clear yet he introduces a lot of additional facts that are interesting (like intro to lab machines and stuff). His tutorial questions are very experimentally based, meaning that you need to design experiments to investigate the intended outcome - with a lot of factors to consider. His exam questions are also experimental design, like it is mainly using experiment techniques from the lectures and applying it to a similar situation (e.g. lecture - mice genetic experiments on circadian rhythm, exam - design experiments to investigate fish circadian rhythm, the fish has characteristics ....), yet there are always one or two questions that nobody knows where it comes from. His classes are the least interactive of the 3 professors, his tutorials is basically him teaching and revealing answers.

Banfield
He is the course co-ordinator and also one of the top scientists in HKUST. He is very out-going and extremely funny, like his jokes make everyone laugh and his classes are just so much fun. He gives out chocolate and biscuits if you participate in class !!! He makes half the class participate but he is very friendly and inviting. He does introduce a lot of important principles of scientific research and does state the important bits for exams, but he does go off the tangent A LOT, but these details are still quite interesting. His tutorial questions are very open-ended, like the choice of topic is actually up to the student and needs so much personal input and decision making. His exam questions mainly required writing, and some were based on his lecture material, like asking 'what is the particular technique that ... used?' a lot were application questions too. I find his modules and questions to be most difficult because the content was not as fixed and the exam questions were very unpredictable.The content was rich, yet quite challenging. It was because the principles explained are advanced and independent from the previous courses. However, it provided students a glimpse at how scientists did their research and tackle problems. Students should find out more and read more aside from the course materials. Honestly, it was too hard for year 2 students.The course was taught by 3 instructors. Overall, their teaching was good. Dr Mak's accent was elegant. His powerpoint was quite informative. Prof Tye's expression was lively. Prof Banfield was humorous, but that was quite stressful during lessons as he picked nearly half of the class to answer the questions. Basically, you can easily stay focus during class.Materials are non accumulative at midterm and final. 3 modules before midterm and 3 after it. Materials are quite hard, need to understand how scientists design experiments and a little background of the famous scientists adn their topic.  Exam paper is quite hard as it asks a lot about designing experiments. Understanding  the  material and then know how to make an experiment to prove sth is important.All professors are quite good. Professor Tye and Professor Banfield always ask questions and will ask people directly during lessons as they are more discussion- oriented. Attendance is only taken at tutorial lesson.there are 9 labs in total, including making buffers, titration, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, electrophoresis, enzyme kinetics, centrifugation, and some assays related to metabolic syndromes.there are different TAs for different experiments, and they will explain the experiment in the first 20 minutes.
some TAs can explain the content well, others are hard to understand. generally, the slides cannot be seen clearly on the screen.
but during the experiment, TAs and technicians are really willing to help.Liu Hong Bin teaches the classification of organisms which includes quite a lot of new words that required memorisation.

Zeng Qing Lu teaches the evolution part which includes the darwin's theory, natural selection, etc. Quite easy if you have taken genetics in secondary school biology lessons.

Ice Ko teaches different kinds of biomes, particularly focuses in tropical rainforests and coral reefs. And some more contents about conservation.Liu Hong Bin: his voice is quite low and what he said can all be found in the notes, so i think it is okay to skip some lessons, if you are attending, you better find a closer seat.

Zeng Qing Lu: quite a lot of videos, his teaching is okay, but also, his notes include everything.

Ice Ko: she is the most interactive lecturer, often asking questions in lessons, most importantly, the handout does not include everything on her ppt, so it is highly recommended to attend all her lessons. Her teaching is the best, not reading words from ppt but explaining things in laymen terms so i am sure you can get at least 80% of the content without memorising.characteristics of life, classification of life, bacteria and viruses, protists, green plants, fungi, animal, evoution, five agents of evolutionary change, speciation, species extinction, the future of evolution, the value of biodiversity, habitat diversity and biome, tropical rainforest, coral reef, ecological conservation and restoration, loss of biodiversity.
I think speciation is the most difficult topic and the topics taught by Dr. ice ko is much more interesting and easier.100% attendance of Dr. ice ko lecture is needed because the lecture notes do not contain the main point for the exam, you need to take notes during her lecture.
Professor Liu spoke very small.
The lecture notes of Professor Zeng is a little bit messy and contain excessive information.
Dr. ice ko does not let us to sit at the last row because she thinks we should reserve the last row seats for those late comers to minimize disturbance.It is a quite easy course, easy to catch up if you have study biology in your secondary school. Syllabus before the midterm is all about memorizing the lecture notes. Syllabus after the midterm is about "blowing water", cuz most of the content is "common sense" if you have studied biology before.Midterm is all about memorizing the characteristics of life such as bacteria, fungi, plants etc.Midterm was not hard, not much covered and some stuff are what you already know. Some students ruined the long question. If you have anything that do not understand during the lecture ( I suppose quite a lot) go ask professor. I think his explanation after the lecture was better to understand.Overall it is good. The only problem is that he jumps to other topics all of sudden, sometimes totally unrelated. He is quite wordy, so lots of times, he cannot finish the content on time.The part with taxonomy was a real challenge for me, so many reciting!! But afterward when it is more about BIODIVERSITY, the part is relatively easier.Except that Dr. Liu speak a bit tooooooooo soft. I think it is acceptable. Dr. Zeng is friendly and willing to answer questions and Dr. Ko is passionate in teaching, it makes me very focused during her lecture, instructor such passionate in teaching vary rare in university, some may think that this is troublesome but I think credits should be given to her.cover most of the part of biodiversity and general biology, just a few parts overlap with LIFS1030. The content go through quite fast, therefore it is better to do some reading before lectures.Quite good overall, Mr. Liu's parts could elaborate more
Pay attention in lectures and remember to drop notes in Ms. Ko's lectures.The basic knowledge about biodiversity on both land and sea, Darwin finches theory and biomass.
The content is somehow easy, and you can understand without difficulties on your own.
I think it is not a must to attend the lecture, especially when it is a 9am lesson. :DLiu Hongbin tends to share self experience and speaks too soft.
Zeng Qinglu is kind but simply reads out the power point.
Ice Ko always asks questions and with a blank ppt. but those missing content can actually be found in textbook.It is easy to follow as long as you have paid attention to the instructors' teaching. It starts with introducing the concept of evolution and classification of biodiversity (genetic, ecological and organisimal) then it will jump into different divided categories (principle of natural selection, microevolution, different sub kingdoms' evolution history etc) followed by a brief introduction of marine ecology
I personally advise you to read the textbooks since they help you understand more about the conceptsIce Ko's teaching pace is rather fast so better attend all her lectures (I am pretty sure the final exam paper was done by ice ko and ATTENTION: some answers are not found in lecture pts!!! I felt like doing a LS paper at that time)
Liang's teaching is okay and he is really nice!
As for Zeng, well he only reads the content on the pts so his teaching is fair
*** don't hesitate to ask them questions if you don't understand the concepts they taught!Topics include:

Origin of Life and Chemical Evolution
Evolution of Life: Darwin’s Theory
Evidence for Evolution
Microevolution (Genes within Populations)
Characteristics and Classification of Life
Bacteria and Viruses
Protists
Green Plants
Fungi
Animals
Five Agents of Evolution Change
Species Concept; Macroevolution (Speciation)
Species Extinction
The Value of Biodiversity
Habitat Diversity and Biomes
Tropical Rainforests
Coral Reefs
Human Effects: Loss of Biodiversity
Ecological Conservation and Restoration

The content is quite easy and straightforward, mostly requires memorization of simple facts. The topics in the middle about different organism kingdoms (bacteria, protists, fungi, plants, animals) are very boring and too many things to memorize. Other topics are interesting.Prof. Zeng is quite nice, explains topics very clearly and shows some fun videos from time to time. Prof. Ko also explains topics well. Prof. Liu teaches the topics about the organism groups which is unbelievably boring and is impossible to stay awake for the entire lecture.

All the professors upload very detailed and clear lecture notes which have every information needed for the exams, so skipping any/all lectures is fine.Lots of new terms from Prof. Liu as he went on describing the classification of life and what falls under each category. He loved using examples from marine biology. His exam was rather easy, although the lecture notes may seem overwhelming. :pLecture notes don't have much words on it, so you've got to pay attention to him when in class. Take notes, don't skip class, and you'll be fine :)classification of organisms, evolution theory , different types of speciations ,  knowledge about different biomes (i.e. rain forest and coral reef)Professor Zeng's teaching was very clear and he showed many interesting video during lectures.
Professor Liu's teaching was a bit boring perhaps because his topics were all about classification
Dr Ko taught very slowly because she always interacted with students and waited for students to answer her questions which is a bit time-consuming.The contents are interesting but sometimes repetitive for science students. Overall has quite a bit of content to revise. Apart from memorising, this course also encourages students to master the contents or concepts given.Both Prof LIU and ZENG has the same teaching style, quite systematic and reads from the ppt.

However Prof KO engages students in her lessons and I love this type of teaching style. This enhances your understanding towards her topics.Practical 1: Freshwater pond microbes
Practical 2: Cell permeability & osmosis
Practical 3: Plant leaf& pigments
Practical 4: Nucleic acid isolation
Group project: Finding out about the microbes in the jar
Total 4 practical and 1 final group project
And there are 2 skill test, which is about using of microscope and using of micropipettor & microcentrifuge, if you pay attention during the lesson then the test is quite easyDr. Hung is very nice. Whenever you send email to ask him question about the lab report and the experiment, he will reply immediately and very contented, all of our questions will be addressed. Some of the TAs are quite helpful (at least ours is helpful), he will give us advice for the procedure of the lab.4 Practical experiments
Practical 1: Freshwater pond microbes
Practical 2: Cell permeability & osmosis
Practical 3: Plant leaf& pigments
Practical 4: Nucleic acid isolation

2 Skill tests

1 Group project: Finding out about the microbes in the jar (around 3 lessons)

1 Peer evaluation

1 Close book final examThe professor will demonstrate the experiment at the beginning of the lesson but still have to read the introduction for having a clearer idea. TAs are helpful and willing to answer questions.Total of Four experiments (group work, 4-5 student)
1. Observing fresh pond microbes
2. Observing cell permeability and osmosis
3. Extraction of green leaf pigments and observation of stoma and guard cells on leaves
4. Isolation of nucleic acid from E.Coli cells

1--Use of microscopes
2--Use of micropipette, microcentrifuge

One group project (Last for a few lab sessions)
---Investigation of a pond microbe sample by doing experiments designed by your own group, any kind of experiments can be done as long as they are approved.

Closed notes final exam

(maybe subjected to change)The professor is patient in guiding us and willing to answer questions. The TAs are helpful also. However, the lab manual usually not been paragraphed, especially the introduction part, better do some pre-lab to have a clearer idea.The course is about learning about different laboratory tools and how to use them and conducting biology experiments.Even though there was not much lecturing in this course, the professor was very boring to me. The instructions and introductions to each lab experiments was very helpful.There are total 9 lab sessions for this course. The content basically teaches you how to use basic equipment for biology labs.The instructor talks a little too much for introduction for each lab and review for worksheet and quiz, so you might feel a little bored. Also, TAs will give a practical session  to students.Well prepared, contains much detail (and therefore too much to read before the lab = = ).Professors are of high quality. Some TAs may be a little shy(speak too soft) but very helpful. Demonstration well performed.just pass/fail, do not skip labs!
a quiz before each lab, and hand in lab report at the end of the lab.Well a little too much material to read before the lab if you really want to understand the procedures. Form groups of 4. At least look through the material before the lab so that you get relatively good quiz marks, also that helps you to finish the lab earlier.The materials covered basics mentioned in LIFS3060, alongside with aseptic laboratory techniques, which are easy for an average life science undergraduate to handle. There was not much demand on memorising for a life science course, the identification of microbes was done with sufficient resources and identification keys. It makes the course focus more heavily on students' skills.Although the pace of speech was a bit slow, the necessary contents were taught clearly without too much sidetracking. The instructors were kind and patient enough to reply any question you raise during lab sections and tutorials.-Some biochemical testing on bacteria
- Practical skill test included

The lab was quite fun because there would be a lot of unexpected and colourful results.

Going to all the labs and tutorial is a must! Most of the teachings have to be included in the lab report and will be tested in the exam.The Professor is very nice and patients in answering all questions. He won't tell you the answer straight away but he will slowly lead you to the answer.

He would also demonstrate the entire lab once before we actually perform it ourselves.

It is a pretty small class with only 20 studetnts, so we have more chances to practice and gain much hand-on experience. He also gave us much chances and time to do the practical skills.Content covers:
1. Basic microbial experimental technique (Culture and aseptic technique)
2. Microscopic and staining technique for morphological characterization
3. Biochemical and PCR test for identification
4. Food and water safety testing methods
5. Symbiosis: Normal flora, pathogenesis of and test for dental caries, life cycle of plasmodium, root nodules formation, and finally a taste of yogurt making
6.Different antimicrobials, sterilization and disinfection techniques, how to test their efficacy and how do they work.
7. Virology, cytopathic effects, serological tests for the diagnosis of viral infection and titer determination, one-step infection test for the determination of burst size and latent periodSince it is a small class, the teaching quality will essentially be higher. Although Dr. Hung speaks slowly sometimes, he is a kind and responsible teacher that he will respond to every question a student ask sincerely. He is also a good friend to students (me) despite the age gap.The syllabus mainly covers DSE topics from a more in-depth aspect. For the part taught by Prof. Herrup, the content is relatively complicated (A-Level stuff). For the part taught by Dr. Tang, the content is all covered in DSE syllabus already.
There are more than ten powerpoints with more than 100 slides each.I think Prof. Herrup teaches very well. He often skipped the powerpoints and added many extra and complicated points to the topic. Also, he spoke quite fast so it was quite hard to follow. I like his accent haha.
Dr. Tang spoke relatively slow and was straight forward. However, she was just repeating almost every word on the power points. You can actually just skip her lectures.As for someone who is interested in biology,it's quite fun and need time to digest especially DNA and neuroscience. Others (I think) are not much different from DSE and easy to follow if you read the ppt carefuly.
Need to remember a bunch of Latin in development.Liang always talks about his research and he became a vegetarian because a bunch of reasons, I nearly fell asleep.

Lam was quite interactive, and uses videos to keep up the mood.But maybe it's the topic I guess (development), the atmosphere was still little awkward.

Herrup was great most of the time, especially then talking about neuroscience. In some other topics sometimes he just reads the ppt and seemed not interested. He uses fun examples but becareful that you need to treat them seriously,because it is either important, or it will show up in the examThe syllabus includes following:

- Introduction; DNA structure and gene expression
- Patterns of gene inheritance
- Chromosomal basis of inheritance
- Development
- Reproduction
- Endocrine system
- Evolution
- Aging
- Circulatory system
- Respiratory system
- Lymphatic, immune systems, infectious diseases
- Osmoregulation and excretion
- Digestive system and nutrition
- Biotechnology
- Nervous systemProf. Herrup explains concepts really clearly so relatively easy to understand.

Dr. Lam's ppts are very organized and he explains it quite well.

Prof. Liang's ppt has fewer slides. But a lot of text, diagrams, pictures in each slide, and he talks quite fast.

You might need to find more information from the textbook in addition to lecturer's ppt.Topic (Relevant chapter in the textbook)

As you can see most topic are the ones we learn in Dse . except some like biotech, development, aging.etc However every topic is a bit advanced comparing to dse. but it's not hard to understand in fact it's easy but lots and lots of thing to remember basically everything that appeared in the power points.besides, it's quite interesting (to me ).So if you have a good grade in DSE(5 or above ) this course is just a piece of cake , just may consume some time. but to the others...........it might be a really hard time .you will be teach by three lecturer- Phillip herrup and liang .I would say phillip> herrup> liang.

Liang: mainlander his English has a bit accent but not hard to hear in fact, satisfactory enough after comparing to other lecturers in ust. will go off topic which is helping you to understand, but you may feel not consistent.most people think it's boring so am I. keep falling asleep

Herrup: the head of the life science department ( Jesus!!) he's an interesting person very good and presented with a good sense of humor. you will really I mean really!! enjoy his lecture. However, at some point, you will feel he is bullshitting because the content is too high-level for most people . and it may not appear in Exam.

Phillip: hong konger  very good at explaining. basically, you won't feel any confuse during the lesson
he also handles rhythm of the class perfectly won't to much or too less. He will also give some examples of the exam (save my life)

All lecture will be record and you can review in canvasMost topics are covered in the DSE syllabus, but are in more detailed ways.

Nervous systemHerrup is the best instructor among three. He speak clearly and in an interesting way.
LIAN speak very slow and boring, so it is better to learn the chapters he teach by yourself in case you fall asleep.
Lam is between two of them.This is an advanced course for DSE Biology learners. Most of the topics were taught in high school. But some of them are new to DSE learners. Reading textbook and previewing PPT is necessary if you want to fully understand what the prof. talking about during the lesson. Also, textbook gives detail explanations behinds mechanism and varies diseases. It helps me a lot when I get lost in class and reviewing the PPT.

Nervous systemLIAN Chun:
He always skips the main points which will be tested in the midterm/final. You have to learn it by yourself.

HERRUP Karl:
He is a good prof. and tries to bring the lessons alive. He uses different jokes and proverbs to explain the complicated concepts.a LOT of detail need to remember.  But the content is something like  secondary school had taught but this course would add more detail information for you.sometime you need to find more information outside the course because the ppt made by professor is not compelete.  Herrup teaching is so fun, he always say joke in lecture.1. DNA structure and gene expression

most curricula was similar to DSE, except "development" which we have never learned before
this course requires a lot of memorization. sometimes professors assume we have learnt it, students may need to search for for explanation from Kyan academy and youtube themselvesherrup teaches the best among the three professors
LIANG has a very strong accentBasically a continuum of your high school courses in life science, except that they go in depth in certain fields of biology.

You learn about many organ systems, such as Circulatory Systsem, Digestive System, Nervous System, Endocrine System, and Lymphatic System.

On top of this, you will learn basic molecular biology as well as some fundamental materials in biotechnology.Professor Herrup is very good at explaining course materials and information, and makes the overall lecture very interesting.

I sometimes lose my focus in Professor Liang's lecture, due to his pronunciation errors as well as disorganized lecture Powerpoint.

Professor Lam's lecture is also very informative and interesting.

However it depends on you whether you can fully understand the course materials. After you study with their lecture videos and ppt, you still will have to ask to the professor directly if you are curious or struggling in some materials.The class contains the basic knowledge of human's system and related common disease. It is really abundant and useful for those who want to major lifs.All of the 3 professors are nice. But I like Lam most, cuz his ppt is the clearest and the most logical one. Herrup is a foreigner and majors in neural system, his class has more fun since he is a fun guyIn fact, I never listen carefully...(I think if you go through the ppt thoroughly that's pretty enough.)goo, contain a lot of things and really interesting, make you know more about  the things about life sciencebad, always read the ppt and make me sleep, but herr up is a good person,I fell that he is doing everything to let us awakesoso,remembr enough things and only multi http://choice.no need to remember all the words,but the final is difficult
I only get B+,BUT i actually skip a lot of classesonly midterm and final, no attendance
and no homework, but need to read the bookstall you can not understand
the contentNo CommentBasic（but deep）biology knowledge about human,such as digestive system and other human organizations,also some evolution thingHerrup is soooo great!!He is a intersting professor who is really good at teaching!Never got bored in class.And he provides relax time during class!
Liang is also a nice professor and try to explain every important details where could have confused students. Once you got a problem he would immediately reply you in Canvas/email.Mainly DSE Content , such as Genetics , breathing system , neurosystem , growth , diversity , and different diseases .Herrup and Liang both are passionate about teaching . If you ask them questions , they will definitely ans you .Fair grade
Midterm:50%
Final:50%
after each exam , they will show the result  of all students . I think it is quite transparent and fair enough .MT and Final both are mc questions . And all of the mc are come from the ppt slides , so if you study hard and revise every ppt after lession , you can get a good grade .Covers most human physiology topics and genetics. Not much new content if you took IB biology - although there's quite a few of new info in genetics. But in some topics IB explained things in more depth which even things out I guess.Both professors are enthusiastic in their class. Professor Liang sometimes tends to drift while talking, likes to talk about his research a lot. He also reads from the powerpoint but that's good because he puts a lot of information in his ppt which makes it easier to revise. One thing he could fix is talking over the informational videos he makes us watch.

Professor Herrup keeps lectures very interesting, making jokes and explaining things in a way that sticks. He explains more than reading the powerpoint so you should at least go to his classes because there's not a lot of information in his ppts.First half, you'll learn about development of biology field and detailed mechanisms of cells. Second half, you'll learn systems such as circulatory, digestive, etc.Professors focus in class. They do know what they have to teach, and what info is needed to understand a concept. I could tell how hard they prepared for the class through the powerpoint they use in class. I wish students who are asking in class get to use the microphone that the professor is using. The professor answers a student's questions, but the thing is, other students do not know what he/she asked.The course is basic intro stuff like DNA/Genetics, Evolution, various organ systems (reproductive, digestive, excretion, respiration, cardiovascular, nervous) and some general stuff like biotech and nutrition.
Textbook not needed, but you can buy it if you want practice and extra reading to well-understand concepts.Prof Liang is funny and has extensive knowledge on the subjects of DNA/biotech. He often likes to ask students in lecture, and focuses on asking/explaining the experimental ways through which discoveries are made. Although he often reads from the powerpoints, he explains things well.
Prof Herrup is same, funny and likes to keep things interesting during lectures with his funny expression and analogies. The only thing is that you should attend his lec/watch the video as he often talks more than he puts in the slides. Also he has some extra "fun" facts in ppts, so its helpful to go to lecture and figure out what is imp for exam.
Both prof are helpful to answer questions after lectures as well.Quite manageable for students who have studied Biology in DSE. Not much things are new. Some new concept that are a bit difficult but they will not appear in exams.Prof. Herrup is good at explaining concepts. His powerpoints are with few words so you need to attend his lecture or watch video to understand his points.
Prof. Liang wants to teach us so much difficult things so sometimes he went off topic. And he actually just copy text from the book to the powerpoint and read it out. Still he is quite funny and teach quite clearly.Introduction; DNA structure and gene expression

Nervous systemYou can't expect much on LIFS lectures as the lectures often have their own reseaches to do, so they don't have much time to prepare, so it's fine to skip all the lectures and revise the lectures notes by yourself;
but,they often introduce some new ideas in research field,so if you are interested in LIFS reseach you should attend the lectures,they are very willing to discuss with students.The content of this course is mainly about human body.  

Before the mid-term:
-Circulatory System
-Immune System
-Digestive System
-Respiratory System
-Excretory System

After the mid-term:
-Nervous System
-Endocrine System
-Reproductive System
-Development
-Gene inheritance
-Chromosomes
-BiotechnologyTeaching is boring, full of information.
It is ok to skip the lessons because no important notes needed to be wrote down.Before the mid-term:
-Circulatory System
-Immune System
-Digestive System
-Respiratory System
-Excretory System
After the mid-term:
-Nervous System
-Endocrine System
-Reproductive System
-Development
-Gene inheritance
-Chromosomes
-BiotechnologyBoth of them deliver their lessons clearly and the notes are so clear that even skipping a class does not affect the understanding of concept.
Attendance would be taken by answering iPRS question but it was not counted in grading.There will be a review of DSE syllabus and most of the HKDSE biology topics will be deeply investigated during the class. Mostly are human physiology and some are microbiology.  Much time is needed to revise the physiology vocabs, also the flow charts.
However, the content will be more than what you've encountered during your secondary school and you have to revise the powerpoint and your notes after classes.IF you are impressed by life science, surely you can manage all the stuff during classes. Apart from the powerpoint slides, you should always stay awake for the extra information added by instructor.
Good command of English is an advantage for students who take this course as you will encounter some sophisticated words that are needed to remember.The content is a continuation of LIFS 1901 (General Biology I) and is almost completely focused on human biology. Topics include:
Wong:
Circulatory System
Immune System
Digestive System
Respiratory System
Excretory System

Tang:
Nervous System
Endocrine System
Reproductive System
Development
Gene inheritance
Chromosomes
Biotechnology

The content, like most LIFS courses is too much. Each topic mentioned above has about 100-150 slides of only memorization.Both professors are quite clear and explain the concepts well. They are also helpful and willing to answer any questions. But the lectures for both can get very boring and as they only read from the lecture slides it's not necessary to attend.I would say it is too much but it's the fact that you cannot avoid.  Every lecture is averaging 100 slides. Therefore, get prepared.

Also, i would say that the lectures taught by Karl are quite a lot more difficult than Jessica's. They require much much more understanding than the topics Jessica teaches. Especially the development part. Therefore, again, get prepared.

Although there is too much content, you'll need that.Both professors are really really good. Both will listen to us carefully and patiently answer our questions after class.

Also, they both are caring professors. For example, Karl intentionally said he will allow Christian students to not attend lectures about evolution if they fell uncomfortable about what he said and he will provide help to them and try to adjust the marks.In-depth teaching for materials that mostly have been covered in high school (genetics, DNA, evolution, development and ageing, biotechnology, and organ systems: reproduction, nervous system, lymphatic & immune system, circulatory system, respiratory system, digestive system, excretory system)
The content is from Inquiry into Life textbook by Sylvia S. Mader, 14th ed. You might consider buying it if you want to read the additional material from the book, but it's not really important. The questions for self-practice is quite helpful in familiarising you with the questions in the midterm and final, although I'd say it was not really similar and sufficient.Prof. Herrup is good but Dr. Tang is not. The lecture videos are available so you don't need to attend the lectures. Dr. Tang only reads from her slides anyway.The course covered topics mainly on DNA, genetics and human biology. If you are interested in human biology and disease, this course will be quite enjoyable.

* Chapter numbers based on textbook chapters of <Inquiry into Life> by Sylvia S. Mader, 14th ed..I went to Prof. Herrup's lectures, but barely went to Prof. Tang's. Both professors did post videos of the lectures, so you could watch them, or just read the PPTs and the suggested textbook.Everything is about basic biology, which most people already get from highschool. Not demanding at all.Jessica was a pain to listen to. She talks in a very robotic fashion, and often only reads from the presentation she prepared beforehand. You will not last 90 minutes listening to her. Randy was much better, he was interesting and engaging to the students.Mainly focused on systems in human body, respiratory system, nervous system,  digestive system, etc,etc. Some other parts (like DNA, evolution) are also talked about in several chapters.
Totally 24 chapters. Knowledge taught is very rich and detailed.
The most difficult part is the vocabulary for many nonnative English speakers like me.Karl is humorous and responsible. He can somehow explain those complicated concepts very clear.
Jessica is not so organized as Karl but still good and clear.Before mid-term: circulatory system, digestive system, lymphatic system, urinary system and respiratory system
After mid-term: endocrine, nervous system, reproduction, gene inheritance, development and aging, chromosomal inheritance and biotechnology
The content after mid-term is much more than that before mid-term. There are over 1000 slides in total.Some videos will be played during the class to strengthen your understanding.
PRS during the class is used to check your understanding about the topic.
Prof Wong's explanation for the content is more detailed. Jessica sometimes just follows the ppt to read.(see course outline for list of topics)
A lot of it was high school biology on steroids
There are probably a lot more details in there though that you'll need to know for the exams.
I guess the course is useful if you want to put biology in a context that is relatable to humans and to daily life (versus other more molecular/cellular level courses later in the LIFS program)

Reading the textbook is helpful but is not a must if you want a good grade (since things are pretty much all taught in class / in lecture notes anyway)

LIFS 1902 is pretty much a make-or-break course. After you take it you'll either feel like biology is your calling (if you like memorization and you see how useful studying biology is) or it's the grossest thing you'll ever study (especially for people who hate memorization). So if you want to know whether studying life science is for you, I'd suggest checking this course out.Jessica is a pretty normal local lecturer
teaches to the notes, kind of reads from it...
I'd suggest you get a cup of coffee before class if you get bored easily
But if you're interested in finding out more you can always ask her after class, she's very nice about talking to students and answering questions.

Professor Poon is pretty... stylistic. You'll hear him talking about history, the arts... etc (and no they won't appear in the final so don't worry about memorizing old abortion drug names)
His teaching is decently interesting, and you'll definitely live without the coffee.
I just feel like he's not very approachable when it comes to questions after class. People say he treats girls nicer though(?)To those who are looking for biochemical pathways and cellular details -- abandon all hope. This course is really about human biology, diseases, and the central dogma (DNA, mRNA and protein -- you know it).

The anatomy part requires some good language sense, and memorization is of course inevitable. Diseases are incredibly fun and not as difficult to study as you might imagine. The developmental biology, though, requires extensive Wikipedia reading and emailing Prof Herrup. It's extremely time-consuming, but the joy from understanding these processes makes it worthwhile.

To be fair though, people who are gonna work at research labs for UROP will probably find this course mostly, if not completely, useless. It's not very helpful for biochemistry courses later on too I guess. So unless you wanna transfer to medical schools (for which this course is near-perfect), just think of the contents as something good to know, and no pressure really.Jessica's extremely nice, but reads of the powerpoints in a slightly sleep-inducing manner, albeit with very clear English. She's pretty helpful if you ask her questions personally, and typically replies to emails within 12 hours.

Prof Herrup is as nice as Jessica, but possesses the aura of a great scientist who isn't afraid of saying 'I don't know', and provides very inspiring, insightful and adequately exam-friendly answers. His lectures are fantastically delivered in a fun, interactive and clear manner. The only thing you'd grunt about him is that he takes quite a few days, if not week(s), to reply, and that's given that he decides to reply. Super professor overall, personal favourite.Difficulty of the course depends on how you study Biology and are you a Bio-lover or not. Mainly focus on Physiology and Simple genetics.
A lot of stuff to remember. As you know, this is a Bio courses, bunches of terms are needed to be remembered.
As I know there are over 20 diseases and 20 hormones.
If you are not interested in Biology, this course will be hard for youBiology is hard to be funny at all, and the content makes the teaching boring.
Wong's deliver skills is acceptable. But the content still make you fall asleep.
Jessica is even boring than Wong, like a high school teacher. But her reply speeds for the Emails are really fast. I tried to write a mail to her just after the lesson, and I received the reply at the evening.Contain some secondary school knowledge.
Topics include internal transport, lymphatic,immune system and infectious diseases, processing food and nutrition, gas exchange, osmoregulation and excretion, nervous system, endocrine regulation, reproduction, development and aging, human genetics-chromosomal basis of inheritance and patterns of gene inheritance and finally biotechnology.
The lecture notes of dr. tang are not well-organised enough and are very messy.
Nervous system is quite difficult.
There are plenty of terms to memorize and it is very very very crazy.Boring and not useful. Many students prefer self-study instead of attending class. The pace of teaching is very fast so the concepts are not clearly explained.
There will be some online exercises on canvas to help you study and clear some of your concepts which are quite important so you should do all of them, But the exercises would not count for any marks.DNA structure and gene expression

Basically a slightly more detailed version of the DSE syllabus.
Perfect transition from DSE to uni, which is great.
Gives a board understanding human biology in general.HERRUP, Karl
LIANG, Chun
LAM, Philip

Teaching is great.
All three professors are very passionate in what they teach, and teaching itself.

Liang tries to include a lot of extra resources to help students understand more of the material. Provides a lot o online materials as well. He tries to thrown in a few jokes as well to make lectures more fun as well. They way he talks could be a little boring, but overall it was great.

Lam really tries to make students feel as comfortable as possible. He makes sure students understand what he wants to deliver to students. He sometimes include iPRS questions as well. His lectures are fun and lively and easy to follow. He plays music when its break time which is so refreshing and fun and relaxing.

Herrup is amazing. He includes a lot of humor in his lectures to make lectures more fun. He throws in a lot of analogy to make students understand the material more easily. He is interactive with the class. He checks on how students are doing before class whenever its close to an exam period. He keeps messing up with the projector tho, that's a bit annoying but I am sure it is annoying for him as well so -

They all give good ppts, although i personally prefer Lam's and Herrup's a bit more.

All lectures were videotaped and put to Canvas.

Having different lecturers or different chapters is not the funest thing ever.- Internal transport
- Lymphatic, immune system & infectious diseases
- Processing food & nutrition
- Gas exchange
- Osmoregulation & excretion
- Nervous system
- Endocrine regulation
- Reproduction
- Development & aging
- Human genetics – patterns of gene inheritance
- Human genetics – chromosomal basis of inheritance
- Biotechnology

All these are good to know, but they are too much. I think they need to be split into two separate classes.Boring. Super boring.lots of ppt slides to memorize
Herrup speaked too fast, so i had to read through the textbook to catch up with the content, otherwise you have to ask him after class to clarify the contentsTheir teaching is very clear and can be easily understood, though Herrup sometimes speaked too fastthe former part of the course is about DNA structure and expression, basic genetics, some of evolution.
after midterm, the course is mainly about the eight systems of human.professor Herrup is very good at teaching and often interact with students. he is usually very nice and funny, giving vivid explanations. But there are times when students did not take the class seriously, talk very loudly in class, or play with the display screen... so the professor may get mad a little. his ppt is too abstract, without much information, so you need to attend the lectures.
professor Liang's class has a lot of information and the speed is relatively faster. however, the class is a little bit boring. the ppt is good.Learnt high school level biology. In the sense, AP BIology/IB Biology High level. For each lecture, we finished half of the ppt on average ( 50 pages out of 100 pages). We went over human physiology in detail. Starting from Basic genetics, we learnt Digestion, Respiration and breathing, circulation, hormones, evolution, excretion, sexual reproduction, and  etc.Prof. Karl's lecture was interesting. He took quiz for almost all the lectures and made sure we knew what we were learning. He taught the first half of the lectures and the rest by Jessica.Before the mid-term:
-Circulatory System
-Immune System
-Digestive System
-Respiratory System
-Excretory System

After the mid-term:
-Nervous System
-Endocrine System
-Reproductive System
-Development
-Gene inheritance
-Chromosomes
-BiotechnologyHerrup and Liang both are passionate about teaching. If you ask them questions , they will definitely ans you.
Herrup is a intersting professor who is really good at teaching!Never got bored in class.Most of the topics are DSE related.Topics are familiar to students.
But there are 2 chapters that are relatively difficult,which are nervous system and aging. These 2 chapter needs more time to study and understand as some contents are new to students.Jessica and Herrup taught so clearly during lecture lessons and their ppt are clear and easily to understand at all. They also provided lecture video for students. You can revise again after lesson.It's a more in-depth summary of HKDSE http://biology.It covers lots of contents with numerous slides. This course requires both understanding and memorisation.Professor Herrup makes the teaching atmosphere more relaxed.Professor Tang teaching tone is very boring,but straightforward. She is more systematic,teaching materials are more organised.I intended to give an A here because of Prof Herrup but a C for Dr Tang, so here it is, a B.
Many would say Professor Herrup speaks way too fast and covers too many complex course contents, but seriously I think this is just the way native speakers teach. It is simply natural for the professor to try and share as much as his knowledge to students.
Dr. Tang, meanwhile, is a typical Hong Kong lecturer. She speaks with a pretty Hongkong-ish accent you might find......rather.......hypnotizzzing. Well in her defense she got the way less interesting part, i.e. human physiology, a topic largely overlapping with DSE biology.The topic covered is really hard. Especially the part from Karl. You can barely understand the topic since week 1. I did some pre-study before class but I still could not catch up. It's about DNA.

And after few weeks teaching, the content become a bit easier. Yet, still challenging if you did not take human physiology elective in DSE. There are lots of new concepts which you haven't heard about it while the other students had studied it before.No lecture video for the course.

Prof. Herrup's assent is good and the lecture is lively. Due to the content, I hardly catch up the meaning though I understand all his words. Sometimes he will cover the powerpoint with a really high speed and he didn't really express so well to deliver some concepts.

Jessica is better than Karl. Fair assent. You can jot down a lot of notes in the lecture and you will find it useful. She expressed better when comparing with Karl.Focuses on genetics and human biology, briefly touching some other topics like biotechnology. It can help you explore whether life science is your preferred major.The teaching is about average. Prof. Herrup is organized and humorous in general but may tend to include overly specific topics with little explanation, forcing you to memorize w/o understanding the logics behind. Dr. Tang is friendly and has easy-to-follow visual aid, but her lectures tend to be dull and lacking in fluency.More details for DSE Biology
If you are interested in Biology, it ia quite fun.
There are lots of hormone, illness and organ name need to know or have in the pptI would say that the teaching of Biology is quite hard to be funny but my secondary school teacher did it great actually.
Anyway, they usually just speak what ppt have but they will answer your questios after lessons. And sometimes they will tell you whether this will provide or you need to recite in the exam. This really matter in Bio subject.There are in total 8 lab sessions, in which you would learning different recombinant technologies, including aseptic techniques, preparing cell culture, PCR, gibson assembly, site-directed mutagenesis, etc. In addition, you have to attend a 50-minute tutorial each week, where you can learn in-depth knowledge about each kind of recombinant technology. Although the contents aren't directly related to the lab session, i strongly recommend you to attend as they would be tested in the final exam.In the first half of the lab, Bobby would give a pre-lab talk to outline and highlight some key points of the experiment (which is very likely to be tested in the exam). Then he would demonstrate the experiment once. You should find no difficulties in performing the experiment  if you pay attention to bobby's demonstration.The lab course will include most of the techniques you need for recombinant DNA. This lab course provide an idea of the principles behind that technique and, of course, detailed steps of each technique. This is a course you want to take if you want to learn cloning techniques.Nothing special for Bobby's teaching, just like his usual style in teaching lab course. He will first brief the particular technique and move on to demonstration. Demonstration will be captured by instant camera, but if you need a clearer observation, do come near the demo bench every time. He will explain points you need to pay attention to during experiment. After all, its mainly your time to complete the experiment. You probably will forget the steps and the lab manual can help you a lot.There are 2 mid-term exams and also one final exam.

For the first mid-term exam, it is relatively easy. It only concludes the part taught by Prof. Tsim.
He highly recommended us to buy the textbook, however, even a year 1 student could find out some misconcepts in the books. I read the whole book seriously and found out that it is time-consuming and also wasting my time, as I have to find the wrong parts in the book and search for the correct stuff. Also, the chapters did tell the students something, but it is incomplete and not really useful, many of the stuff is incomplete. Thus, I really do not recommend any one to buy the textbook and read it. I think search the related topic would be easier to understand. And wikipedia helps a lot.

For the second mid-term, it is basically based on the part of Prof. Raymond Wong. The contents are mainly about the history and policy of the patent. There are a lot of terms, definitions and DATES to remember. Remembering all stuff he said in the lecture and also in the notes would be good for exam. So if you really want to choose this course, make sure that you really have a good memory of it.

For the final exam, it contains 3 parts. 2 for Prof. Raymond Wong's part and 1 for Prof, Joseph Wong's part. For the first 2 parts, it consists of a lot of T/F questions and LQ. Many part of the T/F question is tricky and many of them involves NUMBERS and DATES. So it was really difficult. And Prof. Joseph Wong's part, the first part of the paper is fill in the blanks, and the second part is MCQs.  For the fill in the blanks part, some of them are not mentioned in the lessons nor on the student's version ppt. So, I have no idea what was happening in some of the question. And as I recalled, one of the fill-in-the-blank question is asking the name of the bacteria, which is Bt bacteria. Although he did mention the Bt bacteria and its full name in his lectures, however, I have no idea that the long scientific name would be in one of the spelling question, so I did not get the mark. Although some parts of the MCQs were not mentioned in the lectures, but it is relatively easy if you have do some research on the topics in your spare time.

This is so far the worst course I have ever enrolled in.For Prof. Tsim's part, he teaches with the ppt and sometimes, he wrote something on the whiteboard and asked the students sitting in the front row to answer his questions. His teaching is clear and easy to understand. However, if you don't think to be asked to answer questions or you found that you might sleep in the middle of the lecture, do not sit on the first row.

For Prof. Raymond Wong's part, he doesn't use any powerpoint, all he shown is the pdf he distributed in the beginning of the lesson and the notes he wrote on the whiteboard. He used the whole whiteboard to write the stuff, so if you want to take notes, find a seat that could see the whole whiteboard. Also, his handwriting is not really good, so, it is somehow difficult for me to see what he was writing. His teaching is clear, so I think his teaching is okay.

For Prof. Joseph Wong's part, I have no idea what he is doing actually. Sometimes, he was late for the lectures, and in most of the time, he was not teaching anything at all. As I recalled, many time he stopped in the middle of his lecture he stopped and told us that it is the wrong powerpoint and he would like to find the newest version. And this takes lots of time, and sometimes, he cannot find the correct powerpoint and seemed not willing to continue the lecture. Also, the powerpoint that is uploaded on Canvas is known as the "Old version", the powerpoint slide is totally a mess, the situation is like this: Prof. Wong shows the powerpoint with the projector, on slide 12, you find out that the one he is showing is totally different from yours. Thus, you try to find the that powerpoint slide in your version, and it is slide 34 in the student version powerpoint. And two slides later, all of this happens again. And at the moment that you eventually find that powerpoint slide, he finished his elaboration and explanation. And sometimes, you could not find the powerpoint slide that he is showing at all. And when you want to take a picture of it, he stops you and told you not to. As he is going through the powerpoint too fast, for some slides, he skipped or go to the next slide before you could finish reading all of the words or diagram there. Furthermore, you could find most of the slide that should have diagrams or flowchart on it remains empty, there is only the title. Some happens as he claimed that using the pictures online would not be legit, but he could actually post the website link there so that we could reach it. It would be so much easier for us.
Furthermore, sometimes he told us he actually had no idea what that is and how does it works in the middle of the lecture, and he asked us not to ask questions. Even if you do, he would tell you that you don't need to know the answer, it is just a introductory course.
To conclude, it is like 80% of the lesson time you are not learning, as you are too busy to find the correct powerpoint slide and listening to something not-related.

Actually there is also a doctor for teaching support, Doctor  Leung. The powerpoint she made for the lesson of Prof. Joseph Wong is wonderful. It is a pity that he only showed it for at most 2 minutes (the powerpoint actually has many slide). I wished that we actually could have a chance to read that.Lecture material and exam papers were based on different instructor. (but all are basically rubbish)

Prof Tsim's part:
He will definitely ask you to buy the reference book as he will only use lecture slides provided by the reference book's publisher with a bunch of incomplete content. It seem that you need to use the book to 'solve the hidden message'. (WTF)

Prof Raymond Wong's part:
No lecture slides at all. Only few pictures (yes pictures!) and articles are given. Definitely the messiest lecture materials I've ever seen.

Prof Joseph Wong's part:
I really have no idea of wtf he was doing.All three are basically rubbish.
But Prof Tsim seems to be not too bad among them.
(Trust me, attending their lectures is only wasting your time as you won't learn anything useful. Only recitation of a lot of unexplained lecture materials is needed)This course provides a general overview of fundamental subjects, molecular foundation and basic laboratory techniques of biotechnology. The content is not very organized at times and there are quite a few overlapping parts among the three professors, as well as with other courses such as biochemistry. They also don't strictly follow the syllabus given to us initially. But in general, the content gives a pretty good insight on how biotechnology works and how the technologies can be applied in different aspects.

Prof Karl Tsim basically focuses on the molecular aspects of biotechnology, such as genetics, recombinant DNA technology, and protein products.
1 The Biotechnology Century and Its Workforce
2 An Introduction to Genes and Genomes
3 Recombinant DNA Technology and Genomics
4 Proteins as Products

Prof Joseph Wong, on the other hand, focuses on different areas of biotechnology and the potential applications in the human society.
5 Plant Biotechnology
6 Animal Biotechnology
       6.1 Transgenic Animals
       6.2 Production of Monoclonal Antibodies

       8b Gene Therapy
       8c Organ Transplantation

9 Baculovirus Expression System

Prof Raymond WK Wong teaches the history of biotechnological developments, legal and policy issues, applications of biotechnology, and basic laboratory techniques used in recombinant product production. He basically covers the details of EVERY aspect, and sometimes he just repeats what the other professors have covered, but in MUCH greater detail. If you can catch up on his part, you'll definitely learn the most from him, but for most students, his part is quite overwhelming.

14 Advertisement of His Own Company
       Diabetic Foot Ulcer
       Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)Prof Karl Tsim - D
He basically followed the PowerPoints given by the publisher - how lazy he has been! His teaching pace was so slow at first, and right before the midterm he immediately rushed all the way to finish 2 whole chapters in merely 2 lessons. And attending his lectures is useless - better rely on self-study to survive in the first midterm. However, one thing he isn't that bad is that he conducts the lectures in a more interactive ways than the other 2 professors. He might sometimes ask students sitting in the front rows questions, so get prepared if you sit in the front rows. Regretfully his interaction with the class does not help us understand the lecture content.

Prof Joseph Wong - E
Rubbish. Nobody knows what the heck he's doing. Refuses to reply emails of inquiry from students cuz he's so "busy". His PowerPoints are messy. Dun even wanna waste words to bash on him. However, you still have to pay attention in his class cuz he'll OCCASIONALLY mention some important concepts that might appear on the second midterm.

Prof Raymond WK Wong - B
Quite a lot of students dislike his teaching style - he writes lots and lots of things on the blackboard and you've to write you notes fast enough so that you can catch up on his teaching. However, if you're hard-working and if you can follow his pace, you'll be fine on the final exam.This course provides students with a general understanding and recognition of fundamental subjects in biotechnology and is particularly aimed at students who are interested in declaring major or minor in Biotechnology.

There are various topics in the course and some are listed below.
-the history of biotechnology
-Molecular foundation of biotechnology
-Biotechnology tools in research & development
-Biotech company in Hong Kong and China
-Technological approaches
-Achievements in animal, plant, and algal biotechnology
-Insects
-Healthcare application
-Legal and policy issue in biotechnology
-Ethicalissues in biotechnologyThis course is taught by three professors. Each professor is responsible for seven to eight lectures and they taught different arenas and areas of biotechnology. The teachings are undoubtedly boring. The lectures that taught by prof Wong is fine, but it is vital to write notes in order to score high in the final. Though prof Joseph Wong's teaching might be poor, his exam is fine (the questions did not require much extra knowledge). Prof Tsim part requires a lotttttt of memorisation. You are probably in an advantage if you have a good memory.If you studied biotechnology before, it would be quite easy for you to take up the first half section of the course. But the content in the second half will take you more time understand.The first two lectures are quite boring, they directly tell what is written on the powerpoint. The lessons can be possibly be skiped. However, for the last professor, he will not upload and PDF onto canvas and he will copy th note on his own and distribute them every lesson. That's mean if you skip his class, you will miss the notes. Also, he only gives brief explanation, certainly you will not understand if you do not come to class.Content itself is not hard and very easy to understand. However, the range covered during the lectures is very wide, so this course does require heavy memorisation throughout the course. There are total of three exams from each of the instructor.Professor Wong, Wan Keung and Professor Tsim are relatively good with teaching the content. However, Professor Joseph Wong is a very bad lecturer overall. His ppts are useless and unhelpful, and his teaching is also very unhelpful. I ended up doing self teaching with textbook, so I highly recommend getting a textbook. One good thing about Professor Joseph Wong is that his exam is very easy, especially if you have a strong foundation of biology.There are three parts to this course taught by three different profs, and basically the content just repeats itself. Its the most ridiculous and badly planned courses I've ever taken.

They teach you about the different forms of biotech, methodologies involved in each type, genetic engineering, plasmids, etc.The teachers were terrible, the first lecturer literally used someone else's slides and just read off them. He tried to be funny but he really wasn't. Using some one else's slides was good for us because that meant that the content was understandable and well put.

The second lecturer had the worst slides I have ever seen, they were just blank slides with a few words and images. You had to research topics on your own to understand the topics.

The last lecturer was the prof in charge of this course, WONG, Wan Keung. I actually enjoyed his lectures more than the others, I felt like i actually learnt something.This guy pulled no punches. You have to attend every lecture because this guy write on the board. To keep up you have to constantly jot down what he writes on the board and what he says. This guy was the toughest because he went into a lot of detail. His slides were just topic names and pictures and dates, nothing he said was actually on the slides. Which means in order to pass his test you have to attend lectures.Learn about the basics, introductions to biotechnology, history, molecular foundation, biotech Industries in HK and China,Prof Karl Tsim teaches great and always have interactions with students and he wants us to think more.
Prof WK Wong speaks too quietly and writes all the notes in the whiteboard. So it is really annoying because we found that we barely see the small words and it is really tiring to copy the notes from him. However, he explains the concept quite clear.
Prof Joseph Wong is the worst... It seems that he dont prepare for the lesson in advance. And also blame the internet or his updated version is left in his office...lol... And he just read aloud the ppt so it is useless to pay attention in the lesson...The course is taught by 3 professors. A portion of the content is what you've already known and some of the professors' topics overlapped.Prof. Tsim used the ppt slides provided by the textbook publisher so it was quite clear and easy to follow. However, he loved to jump to unrelated topics from time to time, so, cannot finish on time. He rushed through almost half of his content in the last lecture before the 1st midterm.

For Prof Joseph Wong's part, his ppt slides were not at all organized, just a few words & pics and did not correspond to the student's version. I don't think to attend the lecture would do any help to understand the content as I could hardly understand what he was saying. However, his midterm questions were all MCs and straightforward enough. You can do well by simply memorizing the details in the slides/corresponding chapters of the textbook.

For Prof. Raymond Wong's part, he had a few slides as the content outline but all details were written on the whiteboard. So do come to the lecture early and get the front rows and don't miss a single word. His content was covered in the final, including MCs, TF matching and short questions. Some can be tricky.The course is separated into three parts which taught by three different professors. It has two midterms and one final.

For Prof. Tsim’s part, he is clear enough and his speech is relevant to the ppt. It is quite easy to follow. The questions in midterm is not deep at all, very straight forward, just memorization is needed.

For Prof Joseph Wong part, I could hardly understand what he said and was very difficult to catch up. His ppt is extremely simple, sometimes just few words and pictures. Attending the lectures doesn’t really help your understanding, but I would recommend you to attend the lectures. You often need to find cohesion between his ppt slides yourselves. His delivery was not clear and sometimes discussed thing out of the ppt. However, his mid-term is quite straight forward if you really get familiar with his ppt content. Most of them were included in the lectures. It consists of MCQs only but memorizing all the details in his ppt is not an easy job.

For Prof Raymond Wong’s part, you have to pay attention throughout his lectures and if you want to have good marks, sit in the front few rows and never skip lessons!!! He wrote contents in the whiteboard. I would suggest you write as much as you can in the notes as sometimes, you don’t know what is happening if you just mark down words on the board. His part is quite clear and detailed which you can learn many. And his final consists of MC, TF, matching and short question, basically all content in lectures. Short question is quite hard to do. It asks for details and need to do a few data analysis.not good enough... the exam is straight forward though.Prof Karl Tsim uses PowerPoint for teaching. There are quite a lot of information in the PowerPoint, but if you manged to memorize them, you should be okay for the mid-term

Joseph Wong also uses PowerPoint for teaching, but the PowerPoint is made by himself and they are not very good for revision. The contents inside the PowerPoint seem not very organized, not very good for revision.

Prof W.K. Wong, he writes things on whiteboard for teaching. You have to copy them all if you want to get good grade. However, in my opinion, after copying all the things on whiteboard, when you just do revision and look at them, it is not very organized.

BTW, the course outline sates that Prof W.K. Wong will teach "Healthcare application", "Legal and policy issue in biotechnology", "Ethical issues in biotechnology". However, in the end, he did teach them, but maybe only account for 10% of his lectures, he just taught other Biotech terms and technique for the remaining 90%. I think the stuffs are quite random for the 90% one. My point is, if you are not teaching the things that stated in the course outline, then what's the point of writing them down? Or maybe I am just not getting used to the teaching styles in the University.TBH, I think Tsim is the best among all three, but all of the prof. in this course are still mediocre.

Tsim: He usedPowerPoint for teaching. Making you easy to follow what he said and take notes. He covered quite a number of PowerPoint, maybe you will feel hard to memorize beofre mid-term.

Joseph: The worst prof. Honestly, I cannot believe how bad he was teaching. His teaching is very unclear. You may feel hard to listen to him in lessons. His PowerPoint is awful, like he is showing a 90 pages PowerPoint in lesson but you can only obtain a 40 pages PowerPoint on Canvas, those missing slides will make you have a hard time to follow his teaching. Sometimes, in the lesson, he will say he got a wrong version of the PowerPoint, it makes me feel that he is so unprepared for the lessons. Plus, student version of the PowerPoint notes is strange, he will delete some of the pictures, you may even find a slide with one word or a blank slide. BTW, he said he keeps "edit" the notes each year. In the lessons, he always mentions he is unable to answer so many questions from students via email because he is teaching multiple courses, actually, I have never heard about this problem from other professors, or because of your unclear teaching that causes so many students ask you questions?

WK Wong: He wrote notes on the whiteboard, just copy them all if you want to have something for revision. But I don't think he was teaching well. The notes are unorganized and seems he was talking about random stuffs. I commentate some of his teaching in "CONTENT" part.This course will provide students with a general understanding and recognition of fundamental
subjects in biotechnology and is particularly aimed at students who are interested in declaring major
or minor in Biotechnology.Tsim: Teach great, as the slides are easy to follow. Love talking with you and make friend with you
Joseph: He only talks to himself, so you don't need to care what he says. Just do what you like during the lesson. Don't worry as I found no one is listening to him at all. BE careful as he has 20-years teaching experience(he said).write down note to get good grade.

this course is taught by three professor

for wong's part, you have to write down note, for other you dont have to write. you just have to revise the ppt.all prof teach so bad
you have the ppt
for wong you have to write down all the things on the blackboard to get good grade in the final examFirst part was about plant growth, plant structure...
The second part was about plant hormones and plant movement. There were 6 plant hormones in total and 2 major plant movement.Both professors are nice. They explained the course content very well. They would give a lot of additional information in class, and sometimes the content of ppt are wrong, they would tell you in class, so you better attend lectures.The content is about plant structure, growth, reproduction, photosynthesis, respiration... before the midterm.
The final is mainly about plant hormones and the interaction between them.The lectures are interesting. They are nice and are familiar with the course content, they can explain the concepts clearly.
However, the notes provided are neat, just not self-explanatory as you might expected, attending the lectures and jotting down some extra notes are really needed. (and no lecture videos are provided)The course is basically evil; it is easy on the first half as you talk about basic capillary movemnts, photosynthesis, calvin cycle, and other stuff you know in highschool. After midterm, came biochemistry and molecular biology which will surely make to regret taking this course in the first place.Leung (Melody) was quite nice. She was organised and structured. Her English is not the best, but she tries to be friendly, engaging and helpful to her students. Li Ning was the opposite; he was mad insane. Definitely a mess, he handles the biochemistry an dmolecular biology part of the course and yet he fails miserably most of the time to explain concepts to the students. His presentation was also a sloppy mess and hard to understand.The contents are pretty straightforward and are easy to understand.
The topics range from plant hormones, plant cell structure e.g. pectin, lignin etc. Structure and life processes in plants; cellular structures; molecular and cellar mechanism; transport of water and nutrients; nutrition and soil; reproduction; photosynthesis; growth and development; biotechnology.

Though this seems like a lot, the content itself isn't overwhelming as compared to other courses, and is very interesting if you enjoy learning about plants.I personally enjoy Li Ning's approach to teaching. He always highlights the important concept and "take-home message" after every lecture. He appropriately stresses the confusing part.. and uses good analogies to explain the concepts better. His slides either contain many pictures or too many words. Not all of em would be elaborated or discussed in the lecture, so best to attend his classes ( and for the record, he doesn't record his lectures)

Melody, on the other hand, is alright, her explanations and contents are usually present word for word in the ppt.The content is about plant structure and hormone. Hormone's part is very difficult.Melody's part is easy and do not have much to memorize. The content is clear and you can easily understand.

The accent of Li Ning is terrible. Can hardly understand what he said. The lecture notes are not detailed and clear. You must attend every lecture and pay full attention in order to understand the content as there is many supplementary information that the notes do not include but will appear in the final exam.-Content is good, detailed, inspring

-make you understand why fruit ripe and the corresponding plant hormone

-quite intersting-Li Ning is a good guy, with many knowledge, but he teaches so fast and without clear linkage among the topics

-You can hardly follow his mind, coz it changes so quickly

-Leung is better, feel like high school teacher, detailed and medium speed but rather boringHe has a funny Hong Kong Chinglish accent. But NOT bad - at least he can explain everything clearly, given that you can understand his accent.The five experiments are dissection of rat, digestion of carbohydrate, protein and fat, forensic study by DNA fingerprinting, genetic study by fruit fly and environmental pollution and pollutant risk assessment.The teaching is not clear enough.The content is related to Lifs1902, only with more things to be recited. For example, students are required to identify every bit of the rat's organ.The tutor has a funny accent and often speaks Chinglish without he noticing. Although being a HongKonger like him, I seldom need to guess what he just said. Often spends a long time (e.g. 40 mins) to talk about the experiment and the principal before starting it, which is pretty boring. Do pay close attention to it, as those will appear in the final exam.

And don't let him catch you doing anything wrong in the experiment, or you may get your marks deducted. Try to ask the TAs instead if you have any questions.All related to 1902 but with more detailsExp 1 Rat Dissection
-digestive system
-excretory system
-reproductive system
Exp 2 Digestion of Carbonhydrate,Protein and Fat
-diff. kinds of simple tests
Exp 3 Forensic Study by DNA Fingerprinting
-DNA probe fingerprinting
Exp 4 Genetics Study by Fruit Fly
-Mendel's first and second law
Exp 5 Environmental Pollution and Pollutant Risk Assessment

Generally DSE stuffs. If you study biology before, it is quite easy to catch up the concept.He has a terrible chinglish accent which is quite hard to understand even you are a local student. He only recaps the ppt without much explanation.
Pre-lab talk is way too long, it takes almost 1-hour for every experiment but the experiment may only take you half an hour to finish. You can see many students take out their computer and do their own stuffs or play with their phone but not listen to him.
However, the comments given by the TAs of the lab report are quite useful if you do not understand the concept.Highly related to 1902 lecture course, the experiments are similar every year, for example,  Rat dissection, DNA gel electrophoresis, Toxicity analysis...Before starting the lab work, the professor read the ppt, which is quite boring. But sometimes, you can go out to the instructor's bench, to see how he demonstrates the lab.Lab based on the lecture course, so it was basically what we know. However, the questions that we have to answer after the lab were like of complicated to get the answer at the first hand. Actually, I don't really know the purpose of this lab as the content is so limited to the course that some labs are the one that you can easily think and get the content.The professor read the ppt as it is written in there, but nothing else. The way he presented was so boring that no one really concentrate on his talk. The TAs were so annoying, they showed very arrogant attitude towards students commanding us. One TA said like "Student, clean it." I was uncertain it was due to the lack of her english ability but I was pretty sure that she could be nicer.Rat dissection, enzymatic assay, DNA gel electrophoresis, Mendelian genetics, toxicity analysis (LD50). It's said to supplement LIFS1902, but the only part interesting reallyt is the rat dissection. And oh it's 2 people sharing a rat, so it's less fun than you'd have liked of course. The only thing useful about enzymatic assay is that you gotta know how to operate a pipetteman, which honestly a third grader can learn in 2 minutes. DNA gel electrophoresis -- concept is good since it's routinely used in research labs too, but the techniques taught are just wrong (e.g. NEVER EVER add DNA samples above the wells -- add them into the friggin wells). Oh and the resulting UV-exposed photo usually doesn't show good results, sometimes because of poor exposure by the technicians (you'll know after one or two times at research labs). Genetics is kind of boring, and scary for those who fear arthropods. Toxicity analysis is kind of brutal too, just watching those little creatures suffocating and dying in the toxic solutions.
What's worse, you wait and wait and wait and chat and chat and chat until you've got nothing more to chat about and the wall starts to become really interesting.Boring. Boring. Boring. It's literally just a reiteration of what's been covered in LIFS1902, with a bit more of experimental techniques perhaps. Bobby's not exactly the funniest instructor, but considering his hilarious pronunciations he fares well in that department. Plus, you've got a huge crowd gathered around the instructor's bench, which makes it extremely difficult to hear him clearly, let alone seeing what he does / demonstrates, if you're sitting at the back.- Rat dissection
- Enzymatic assay
- DNA gel electrophoresis
- Mendelian genetics
- Toxicity analysis (LD50)

Easy and simple. Learning very basic skills, which may already be taught in secondary school.Experiment content including theory, procedure and precaution would be gone through by TAs at the beginning of the class.
But it is quite boring and time consuming, as you should do pre-lab before the class.Teaches you basic concepts in plant biotech and touches upon topics such as genetic engineering in plants, protein extraction, drug synthesis in plants

Li Ning: genetic engineering in plants and different plant parts
- Herbicide
- Promoters
- Agrobacteria mediated genetic engineering in plants
-Using cotton, flowers, fruits, plant secondary metabolites as targets for genetic engineering
Melody: conventional methods on plant culture and compound extraction in plantsLi Ning: has a lot to teach, but is not detailed enough, may require more research on your own time
Melody: quite detailed and comprehensiveThe content is quite comprehensive, have taught you steps on how to do biotechnology (which could be applied in other biotech courses.) and the applications of different areas in plant biotech.

Li Ning, talked on the theory and applications of plant biotechnology on various areas , e.g. flowers, fruits, cottons.

Melody, taught more on the process of how to genetic engineer a plant, knowing which part you want to GM and the desired product biosynthetic pathway, isolate/extract the gene of interest, bioassay, culture of plant cells.

Li Ning -
Chemical Inducible Promoter
Agrobacterium (use of Ti plasmid)
Herbicides
Cottons
Flowers
Ribozyme
Gene Silencing
Fruits
PTM-Proteomics

Melody -
Medicinal Plant
Medicinal Algae
Identification, Extraction and Bioassay
Plant Cell Culture
Plant and Algae as Drug FactoryLi Ning -
For me, his topics are much more difficult than Melody's part as you need to be really familiar and understand the theory behind the topics in order to answer his MC questions in the exams correctly.

He tried to explain in class, however I think the depth of knowledge he explained  is not enough for you to answer the exam. So extra effort is needed after class to digest and revise and even go on Google to search for the theories.

Melody -
She explained very clear on her topics and asked questions to make sure you understand what she said.Content was quite interesting. Just as the course title is indicating, the course teaches about applying biological concepts to make real life plant products.

Melody part was about extracting, cell culturing and bioassay. Just straightforward concepts Prof. Li Ning covers a variety of topics: cotton biotechnology, Agrobacterim mediated gene modification, herbicide, flower genetic engineering and so on.

The course has midterm, final and two presentations. One presentation is just summarizing a paper that is related to the course topic. Not a hard one.
Second one is pretty interesting, both in a good way and in a bad way. It is called an innovative project, where you have to come up with a product that is commercially feasible. He focuses mainly on "innovation", whether the idea is original.
Actually he gives grades generously (or hilariously)for the presentation, so i think the exam is still the key for the grade.Melody
She talks really fast and to be honest, not very good at explaining. She jumps to next sentence without finishing her last sentence. Her tone is high and bright, but monotonic: when she was asking question, it took everyone 30 seconds to realize that she was actually asking something.

Li Ning

Teaching is not bad, but after taking two course of his, i am pretty sure he forgets what he said. Never believe when he says it will only cover up till this, or this will be tested; it will never happen. You need to study every detail that is written on the powerpoint.Aha! A space virgin course.
To be frank even somebody as cynical as I am (see review on LIFS 3160) couldn't find much to get pissed at over this course.

Dr. Ng started with an overview of first generation biotech drugs like insulin and some slightly technical recombinant DNA techniques. He then moved on to student presentations for most of the course, but you could see that he was actually good at what he did - he basically knew everything the presenters were on about off the top of his head and asked critical questions to help us think.

The course was more drug development and business-focused than biochemistry-related, which was a great change from all the technical courses you poor suckers have been doing.He's great! Multidisciplinary, super fast with emails, business-focused and sharp, he's awesome. Worked as head of R&D in the States for 30-odd years. Nothing more to be said.The lecture is updated and informative that includes information of the newest techniques, introduction of top selling drugs and famous biotech companies. The lecture was in the form of group presentations. Every group was responsible for an assigned topic and then we have 20 minutes to deliver the talk within lesson.

Topics in 17-18 fall includes:
Drugs: Afreeza, remicade,  humira, Herceptin, Avastin, Lucentis, enbrel
Companies: celgene, abbott, gilead, 23&me, novartis, BGI, amgen, roche
techniques: cloning, stem cells, botox, golden rice, cancer immunotherapy, car-T
Others: venture capital, etc.

I guess the topics will be similar for the upcoming semesters but may change with the trend in market.Even most lecture content were delivered through students' presentations, NG also told us lots of supplemental information, and most importantly, what he mentioned in lessons are the key points that appear in the exams, so do attend every lessons and mark things down.Super useful and interesting. It is heavily based on the presentation given by the students. The professor only teaches like 4 lectures (just add and drop), but I hoped he could do more as his lecture was really enlightening.

He starts with basic biotech issues and concepts: insulin, genentech and current issues in biotech industry. After that, every lecture is about student's presentation. It is supposed to be 20 mins per group (2-3 persons, mostly 2), but if the topic is intriguing, he is indulgent with time. The topic covers from movies related to biotech ethics to current biotech companies and top-selling drugs. It was a meaningful lecture to know more and deeper about the biotech in real life.He is multi-disciplined, kind and intellectual. A bit of disappointment that he gets to teach only 4 lectures. He welcomes students with career woes so feel free to talk with him. He is not reluctant to help and give advice to students at anytime.personally, I think the content is quite useful and interesting
talk about our whole body, our heart, our brain, how to maintenance our health
all the topics are related to our daily lives
definitely can help us understand more to ourselvesits ok
Philip has a great amount of interaction with students (maybe cause he uses the IPRS, i don't know)
he shares many his own experience
adequate teaching time
his classes are always lovely
Helen is also trying hard to teach us but
she does not show that much enthusiasm as Philip
she is also nice yet her teaching is quite boring
sorry for playing phone during her lessons xdDifferent organ system such as circulatory, nervous system
Environmental healthDr Lam often include examples explaining the content. Quite funny and impressive. His teaching is easy to understand even for students with no biology backgrounds.
Helen is the worst instructor I have ever seen. She always makes mistakes in her iprs and quiz, which is very confusing for revision. She will also talk about knowledge or specific biological vocab without spelling the words out. It is extremely hard for students with no biology backgrounds to catch up.The content is pretty basic. If you have taken biology before, the lecture slides will be pretty easy to understand for Dr. Lam's lecture, but Dr. Cheung's lectures are not as organized and sometimes lack logical flow, which can make it challenging for those without background in biology.Dr. Lam was a superb instructor. I give him an A+++. He made the lectures interesting, and his English was probably one of the best I've heard here, probably because he studied abroad in the states.
Dr. Cheung is mediocre when compared with Lam. Her English is not bad, but I feel like she doesn't prepare for her lectures enough beforehand? It feels like she's just trying to come up with explanations for the content on the spot, and she skips around the slides quite often. Her lectures could be more organized.The content is quite boring but it might give you some knowledge about diseases, at the first time I thought that this course will give you some basic biology knowledge, like the structure of cells or something. But indeed, it does teach you some knowledge about biology, but most of the time it teach you the diseases and healthy lifestyle.Admittedly, Lam's teaching style is the greatest. Roberts is mediocrely acceptable, perhaps is because of his accent. I can barely understand his accent as a matter of fact. Helen....... HeHe....
She basically just read out the slides, and as I remember, in Lam's class, the attendance is around 90%, and it dropped drastically to 50% or even less when Helen takes charge.Topics including Cancer, human brain(more psychology), aging, pollution, different body parts.
Essay is related to what mentioned in class.Philip was great, his class is more casual and relaxing. We can ask question in class anytime.
Helen seems not prepared well, sometime I really fell sleepy.total four pop-up quiz, likely have a quiz after two/three ppt.
All are MC questions in midterm, final and quiz.
C+ for mean.So many special terms to memorize, it was too harsh for me because i can't memorize things well.
Workload might be light to those whose mother language is English because most questions are common sense if you know that word.most of the time the content is within the range that I learned in senior high school, i remember the instructor saying this course is intended for students who have little background in LIFS. Covering global warming, body structure, brain, cell....not very deep or trivial.the Lam, Yeung. KO is a very nice instructor with sense of humor and proper structure of teaching, at the meantime, very responsive.
While, Helen is a mess, I don't really know whether she prepared for the class before coming to the classroom.
I will give Lam an A and Helen a D.The content of the course is quite interesting; you learn about the ocean, how currents, wind, etc works and their correlation with productivity and biodiversity. Then it moves on to marine animals from bacteria, plankton to mammals. Finally it discusses about marine biomes like intertidal, subtidal and estuary.The course starts with Qian. He's alright; he's an expert in marine biology so he knows a lot of stuff. He is like a grandfather you always know --- talks too slow, talks gibberish most of the time, often doesn't make sense. Wang was bad ---- most of what he talks about doesn't have any content. It took serious effort to really focus on the classes. As bad as Wang, nobody beats Liu, he was horrendous. I gave up going to class because he was THAT bad. He's uninspiring, lectures are boring, very unprofessional and lazy. Don't even bother to go to his paperchecks because he's so lazy to change your grades, he would make ridiculous and stupid excuses to weigh your answers down.Interesting topics for an undergraduate student to learn about the marine biology.

Introduction to Marine Environment
Physical and Chemical Oceanography
Virus, bacteria, archaea
Cyanobacteria and protists
Primary Producers (phytoplankton and macroalgae)
Zooplankton

Professor Wang:
Cnidarian and worms
Marine molluscs
Marine arthropods
Marine arthropods
Echinoderms

Professor Qian (Course coordinator):
Coral Reef Ecology
Intertidal ecology
Subtidal benthic communities
Estuary
Hydrothermal vent and Cold seeps
Biogeochemical cycles in marine ecosystemsProfessor Wang's lectures were well-prepared. He thought of some interesting examples to illustrate the concepts that made students understand more easily.

Professor Qian's lectures were fruitful. He talked about marine environments and some biogeochemical cycles in the marine ecosystems. I think you should sit at the back of the classroom if you are having his lectures as he always turns the volume too loud that you may feel a little bit annoyed.

Professor Liu had a relatively casual teaching style when comparing to other lecturers. His slides were sometimes lacked information that you have to pay extra attention in his lectures. You may need to jot down sufficient amount of notes for your study in the future.Midterm covers different classes of marine organisms. You need to memorize the structure and function of different organisms. There will be mainly MC and short essay questions. Not too difficult if you have enough revision. Questions are quite strict forward, but be careful to also look at the graphs in lecture notes, make sure you don't miss any details.

Second half of the lecture is taught by Prof. Qian and Hongbin. The format of final is similar to midterm, with MC and 4 essay questions. I think Qian's questions are more challenging, he likes to ask something not found or taught in lecture. You need to fully understand and integrate your knowledge to answer his questions. But don't worry too much, we only need to answer 4 out of 5 essay questions.Hongbin's lectures are boring. He is more like talking to himself but not to the class. But his lecture notes are very details, enough for you to understand everything covered in exams, so his lectures in my opinion is optional.

WANG only taught before midterm and I don't really remember his teaching. I think his part is normal and fair. With a little bit accent but still easy to understand.

QIAN's lecture notes are super messy and not so organised. It is important to attend his class because he might talk something not included in notes but appear in exams. He loves to spend most of his time talking about one particular page and then go through the rest swiftly.The content is quite similar to the previous ones but due to tight teaching schedule, some topics weren't covered, like shrimp farm and so on. It mostly covered diverse natural habitats such as sandy beach, mudflat, estuary and coral reef. I would say that it is important to know abiotic and biotic factors of various habitats and give comparisons.I think the teachers are fairly good. To be honest, I didn't listen to the lectures cuz I was always daydreaming, haha.Rich content about marine biology

Midterm: sponge and microbes in ocean, plankton, and primary production in marine

Final: fish, arthropod, echinoderm, oyster farm, shrimp farm, marine mammals, mollusks, Carol reef, various aquatic habitatsI am sorry to say I seldom go to class
I can't tell whether the teaching quality is good or bad

But Qian is a good teacher at least. Able to explain those complicated concepts.Topics:

Introduction to Marine Environment
Physical and Chemical Oceanography
Biodiversity of Marine Life
Sponges
Microbial diversity, function and processes
Biogeochemical cycles in marine ecosystems
Primary Producers (phytoplankton and macroalgae)
Primary Productivity in Ocean
Harmful Algal Blooms and Possible Mechanisms     
Marine Mammals
Marine Fishes
Marine molluscs
Marine arthropods
Echinoderms
Coral Reef Ecology
Coral-microbe symbiosis
Intertidal ecology (rocky shore)
Intertidal ecology (sandy beach/mudflat)
Subtidal benthic communities
Estuary
Mangrove and Wetland
Hydrothermal vent and  Cold seeps

Some of the topics, at the start and end of the course are interesting. But the topics in the middle - arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms, etc. - are extremely boring and useless. Too many details about the different animal groups. Lot of memorization in all topics.Qian is quite interesting and engages well with students. Liu does not explain very clearly sometimes, and Wang's lectures are extremely boring.
All 3 professors upload very detailed and good lecture notes which are helpful for revision after exams.Topics include:
Banfield:
Properties of cells
Composition of cells
Study of cells
Cellular genomes
Eukaryotic chromosomes
Biomembranes
Membrane transport
Protein targeting
Nucleus

Guo:
Vesicular traffic
Cellular homeostasis
Cytoskeleton, cell movement
Cellular communication
Cell division
Reproduction, genetics
Extracellular matrix
Cell communities
Stem cells, cancer

The content does not require any Bio background. It may seem like a lot but each topic is finished in 1 lecture and is about 30-40 slides. There is a lot of memorization involved but it is quite interesting. The course is a requirements for courses like Animal Physiology, Plant Biology, etc.Both the professors are excellent. They explain all the concepts very clearly, are enthusiastic and passionate about the subject, and always willing to help with any difficulties. The lecture slides and video recordings are uploaded but it is worth attending the lectures even at 9 am.You learn about basic cell structure (membrane, golgi etc), transprtation and signalling. Every life science student must take this course.Prof. Benfield
Overall it is good. The only problem is that he jumps to other topics all of sudden, sometimes totally unrelated. He is quite wordy, so lots of times, he cannot finish the content on time.

Prof. Guo
New professor in UST. He wants to talk with us, asking about lots of things (school life, academic life etc.) His ppt is amazingly good. Very organized, easy to understand.Though the course name is biostatistics, I don't see any linkage between biology and statistics. In fact, the course is more like a statistics course than a biostatistics course.
Anyone without biology background but good in statistics (like t-test, correlation, chi-square) can easily understand the content of this course and do well in exams.Basically, teaching following what written in the PowerPoint.
English is ok but quite bored especially it is a 9am lesson

He will answer question after every lesson and could see him quite passionate in that. So just feel free to ask him after the lesson or even during lessons.

One point is that he pretty much like to release the lecture notes after the lessons. Once he just did not release notes after a whole week and he said he forgot it.Fundamentals of Statistics, type of data: numerical, categorical and the graph used to represents their relationship, statistical inference, confidence interval, t-test, ANOVA. To make the course more "bio" related, a lot of the case example used in lecture materials are agricultural or medical studies.

The contents covered is definitely useful. Statistical concepts really teach you to think rationally. The contents also allow you to spot the flaws in statistical design and see through misleading statistical conclusion.Slightly boring. Professor Liu missed out a lot of opportunities to be interactive with the students and to stimulate us to question the statistical concepts in different cases. During the lectures, normally it's just him talking in a plain tone. Despite the plainness, the teaching is actually clear and logical.Too much and too complicated. Some content is about the most recent technologies. If you don't attend the lecture then its hard for u to learn by yourself.Detailed but you have to attend all the lectures in order to understand the lecture notesToo competitive in this course.Most of students in this course performed really well and they are really interested in research. If you just wanna take an easy course to fullfil the elective requirement.Definitely not recommend ,otherwise you get poor grade.1 presentation,1 data mining and 1 open book finalabout many genetic diseases and how to study them.
good to take this course in year 3 since some contents are same as Lifs 3010 and Lifs 3140. You can spend less time to understand the content !Both professors speak good English and explain the concept clearly.very interesting.There are different kinds of genetic disease and their mechanisms.Also different experimentnal design and skills are taught to diagnose them. Many knowledge are advanced and new which is very satisfying.It is taught in a case study approach.Through different cases, papers, analysis is carried out and different knowledge and medical practices are discussed.The course is quite funny and useful. More like an indepth version of LIFS 1902. Yet, it omits some of the tedious part e.g. kidney, which is good. Although the official syllabus seems to be really board and cover a lot of topics, as Prof. Miller taught relatively slowly, He can never cover the whole scope so he will just examine the topics covered. Usually, the last one or two topics of his part will not show up in the mid-term exam. (Prof. Miller teaches before mid-term and Pingbo after mid-term) The final exam is not accumulative.Prof Miller is a funny guy, so much better than Pingbo who is quite boring. Miller likes to repeats the same concept for several times from various approaches so if you do pay attention to class, you can definitely grasp all the concepts easily. And he is a really nice guy, wiling to take  questions and conduct the lesson in a relaxing and interactive atmosphere. While Huang speaks in a boring tone although the content is alright but he can easily hypnotizes me. He does not simply read through lecture notes which is good but also give extra ideas related. And he made a lot of practice questions which are similar to the exam questions.At first, prof. MILLER shown us the syllabus of the course and we "wow"ed because there were over 1k page of PPT. But after studying, most of the pages were repeated and he could only teach half of the syllabus.I give A for prof. MILLER because I really love him. He is a kind and funny man who will input many jokes during lecture. I give C for prof. HUANG  because he is rather boring compared to MILLER and he just read the PPT to us.Curriculum include muscle, nervous system, cardiac, endocrine, digestive system, etc.
There are a lot of modules in the course, but it's unlikely they will finish all the modules in time. So they just test you on whatever they taught. But most topics are fundamental knowledge that are very useful for further study in life science.
Structure of the course is simple, just mid and final exams, suitable for those who dislike taking attendance or doing homework.The first half of the course is taught by an Australian professor Andrew Miller. He is very friendly and has a fun teaching style. Second half is taught by Pingbo, a Chinese professor, which has a more technical teaching stylemost of the content are the same as lifs 1902 and the things that you learnt from high school, just a little bit more explanation, and the teaching method is different.they are not teaching the things appear in exam, just show some examples in class and explain them. I totally don't know what they want to teach us.they won't tell you the marks that you get in the exam or even the essay. So I don't know which parts I did bad and how come I get a C- in this course. I attend the class after add-drop period and I think that they also count attendance during add-drop period. So maybe they deduct my marks from that.a lot of reading material.
The essay is quite difficult cause you have to use no more that 400 words to write a comprehesive essay.
you have to finish a quiz before each lessonSyllabus

Final examination 60%It is a combination of lecture and classroom teaching. Some instructors will have more interactions with you but some will only give boring talking. Sometimes, they will have role play and discussion. I like discussion because you can speak with your group mates and "Hea".Most of the content are overlapped with LIFS1902
But they are quite simple
Recommend this course to those who also study LIFS1902
But you can only absent 2 classThe course mainly relies on your own online study and some of the details in class
Philip is very good
But the others..........I can only say they prepared well, and thanks for making science more boring:)Tutorial (1.5hrs) and weekly canvas quizzes (10 min of ur time, 10 questions usually)
Quiz to be submitted a day b4 ur tutorial session

Jessica: ecology, evolution amd conservation biology. Not too difficult. Good instructor
Philip: animal form and fx, cell signalling, nutrition
Helen: animal biotech,  genetic engineering, genetics
Melody: plant biotech, stem cells, bioethicsJessica explains succinctly and keeps the course interesting. Willing to answer questions
Philip likes to include stuff outside the reading materials in his tutorial sessions. Very nice instructor and very informative. Looooong reading material
Helen's part is quite simple but she makes it more complex than it shd be in the reading materials. Still a good instructor and will answer many questions in great detail. Light reading material. Her quiz questions co me from some online website accessible by students, but the questions are not always relevant to her reading materials
Melody oversimplifies her part, in my opinion. Her tutorial has students discussing amongst themselves without giving much directions to students, so it results in awkward discussions at times. Reading materials can be a bit confusingBasic biology and biotechnology

Intended Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, students will be able:

To acquire fundamental knowledge through computer-assisted learning in the areas of biochemistry, biology and biotechnology.
To cultivate self-paced practice, feedback and monitoring of self-progress.
To be able to inaugurate global connection.
To be able to utilize in-class game-based / case study activities to reinforce online learning.
To develop higher order skills in order to make critical and rational judgments over societal concerns in life sciences.
To seek and share biological knowledge, independently and in collaboration with others.The tutor will repeat the online material and have some discussion.It is a relaxing course.
You just need to memorise all of the self learning things by yourself.
Some online quiz questions can bo found on google.
Those teaching does not help a lot.
Answering questions on lessons will get bonus marks but it doesn’t help a lot.They said 50% is taught in lesson.
The other 50% is self learning.
But it is 100% self learning for the final examination.
Those teaching is useless but it may be useful for deciding the topic of the essay.Just basic biology stuff and most topics are easy to follow. For LIFS1902 people or high school biology students, it will be a simple revision.No lecture. Only some briefing followed by group discussion. Some instructor did create a good discussion atmosphere while most not.Easy to score A range if you can get the regular quiz web work correft and do  satisfactorily for a short written assignment. Final is easy if you go through the material once before the final.Depends if you read the weekly material regularly. Have weekly web work with only 10 questions each and a short written assignment to be done during study break.Tang:

Topics are broad but not in-depth. I think it is simliar to HKALE Biology(not so sure since I study HKDSE Bio but most topics are more in-depth than DSE). Don't need to put too much efforts on the biochemical reactions in the contents(the complex protein names...)

Blended learning: You read all the reading materials on canvas(similar to textbook/lecture notes in regular courses, have some Flash/videos), as well as the tutorial materials(the basis of tutorial activities, though most of us read them right in the tutorial sessions). Then just go to the tutorials and take attendance and learn and also get bonus marks for answering questions. In the tutorials you sit in pre-assigned groups and usually there will be group discussions. Good chance to meet some friends too.Tang: Generally ok. (already forgot her teaching since she's in the first 3 lessons)
Lam: Passionate and tried hard to get us to actively answer questions and show our understanding by not using the wordings in the materials to explain the answers. Tutorial materials are well-prepared.
Cheung: She can explain concepts clearly and used whiteboards to ensure that our concepts are accurate. Not very interactive though. Tutorial materials are ok.
Leung: Very relaxing teaching(lol). Just go over some main points then let us 'group discussion' in the rest of the lesson. If she is not nearby, then our group will just chat on whatever topics as if it's break time. She will come over every group to facilitate meaningful discussion on the tutorial questions(and did a good job since we really learn more after the discussions)Covers DSE Bio topics
like biodiversity, ecology, animal form and structures, animal & plant biotechnology, ethics, etc.
Due to its diversity and time constraint, tutors won't explore deeply into each topic.
Mostly DSE-level, yet there are some new terms that haven't been mentioned during high school years.
Reading the materials is suffice for finals.Jessica: She is very nice and has a soft voice. Encourages students to take part in discussions.

Lam: He likes students to explain a bit further. Don't need to use jargons, but you should be able to explain the concepts precisely.

Helen: Shows most professionalism because she looks the most serious(?) Similar to Lam.

Melody: Uses most of the time to help out students to brainstorm ideas for her essays. If you are ever assigned to hers, then you're in good hands, else it's justing wasting your time to attend.Super easy. Read all ppt and tutor notes are enough. Not much need to be understood.Some are good. Some are boring and students are quite inactive usually.Good.Okay. Remember to do quiz every week. BUT the essay topic allocation is super unfair. Some students were being allocated by very easy topics, just a few clicks on the internet can find tons of information and references while some topics are difficult to find enough information to write about and the content of the topics sounds easy but in fact acquired deep understanding of difficult knowledges and essay reading skills. It may cause problems for non-lifs major or students with weak english.The content is not difficult. If you have studied other life science courses before , you can even skip revising some chapters.All tutorials. They takes attendance and you can get bonus marks by answering questions in classes.Philip is good. You can learn biology that is not for exam on lessons. But I remembered there was a instructor that didn't come at all because of sick leave. But that won't affect so much because the exam mainly based on the notes on canvas but not the content on tutorials.As a non-bio major year one student who studied DSE biology, the contents are still mostly easy. The more difficult part for me is about transcription and translation.Since this is a blended learning course, tutorials are mostly for exchanging ideas but not teaching. Students are required to learn the given online material by themselves.It covers introductory part of some advanced courses such as cell bio, biochem and etc. Since I have taken 2040 and some other more advance LIFS courses before, the content is easy to handle for me. However, this will be tremendously difficult for ppl who have limited  knowledge to biology so please don't take it to fulfill Sci school requirement if u give a damn about your grade.Due to the nature of the course (Blended learning), I rarely attend the tutorial which student exchange idea. Thus I cant give a very clear insight into the instructors' teaching quality. But in the few tutorial that I attended, I think Dr. Lam's tutorial is really fun and engaging. I can feel his passion in teaching and he would send message to support us and encourage us to ask question.Mostly overlapped with LIFS 1902. The notes are quite detailed and long. Topics are about biotechnology, cells and biodiversity.So many discussion during lessons but still it is a bit boring. Attendence is not counted.Memorize and understand all the notes and you will get a good grade. But it takes time to read through all the notes you got .Have an essay to be handed in at the end of the course, which the questions are easy to answer. There are weekly online quizzes. They wont take you much time to complete them.The content of this course is much overlapped with LIFS 1902. There are too many simple and broad concepts invovled in the tutoral material. But it really takes time to memorize, but the exam is really simple, makes you doubt about what you have learned.Lecturers for this course are mostly energetic, except Helen, who seems to be absent in teaching and not prepared.Because the teaching is based on group discussion and case study, they may have tried to motivate students to participate, but the results are always awkwardness and silence.This in part is the students' responsibility, of course.Divided into modules, most of these are simple biology stuff that you probably have learnt in high school. Just a bit of new knowledge that can be handled pretty easily.

I usually do my own stuff or chat with my groupmates. You can actually learn it all from the canvas materials yourselves without giving a sh*t about the lessons. Yet, I find the materials to be a mess sometimes, so it might be better to make your own notes from the materials given.High school level bio stuff.

(What is wrong with this review system? Why bother to make it a so-called 'adequate' length?)You learn with your laptop only.

(What is wrong with this review system? Why bother to make it a so-called 'adequate' length?)No lectures, don't even have to attend the once-a-week tutorial.

(What is wrong with this review system? Why bother to make it a so-called 'adequate' length?)The content is quite outdated and useless for understanding fundamental concepts in this field. Many resources introduced in the course are no longer in use. I believe most people take this course just because they need the credits.The professor's English is not clear enough. The lectures are boring. The lectures are also not useful for exams.A memorizing and boring course. You can learn some bioinformatics softwares and tools.The most important part of this course is the principles behind the tools and softwares.How they work and their pros and cons.She just read out the notes. There is a review session before every exam,she will tell u which parts are important .
When you do revision,you just have to read the content in review session lecture.Things other than review session are almost not examed.Despite its course code of 4000level, the course isn't as difficult as it seems. You mostly learn about types of programs or techniques (e.g. Microarray, use of Databases etc) used to study DNA sequencing, protein sequencing etc. Although professor gives out simple exercises we can try at home for each lecture, they won't be covered in exams. At the end of the course, it felt like I didn't really learn anything applicable at this instant, because you're learning more about the theories of how they work not how to apply them.. You might find this course easier to understand if you've taken course Biochemistry I.You sometimes have to try hard to make out what she's saying because she speaks really soft. Her lecture notes are very concise, so you have to attend the lectures to understand them. She gives you a short review summarizing materials learnt before every exam.If you have biology and chemistry background, it would not be that hard for you. There is lecture video provided so if you have anything do not understand, you can follow the lecture video.Good teaching, easy to understand.Overall is easy to study
Started with classifying 20 different AAs. Then the formation of Protein from simple AAs. How to build the 1st to 4th level of Protein structures.
Then will be DNA replication and Transcription, Translation. Not very detailed.
The content is straight forward, but you have to spend time to memerizeRobert is a mainland prof, but his pronounciation is understandable. Except his “th-” sounds will turns to “s-” sounds.
But he was always just follow the ppt. I dont think you will miss any thing if you skipped his lessons.
Quick answering after the lesson.
(No video provided)The professor introduces various disciplines in biochemistry. There's a lot of basic biology facts (such as proteins, DNA, lipids) with few additional "more sophisticated? biochemistry-related" information.  I suggest you go to all the classes, as he mentions things that are not in the ppt that appear in the final exam. Overall, if you have background in biology, it will be relatively easy.The best professor I've seen in HKUST so far. Although he does make some minor mistakes in class, he delivers the content in a short but information-packed manner. Also, the class often ends within an hour if he's done teaching. He has amazing time-management skills (unlike many professors in HKUST who are unable to finish one ppt in one lesson). He also arranges many Q&A sessions where you can comfortably ask him any uncertainties.The content of the whole course is heavy, but with biology background would be ok. The power points are clear, with detailed explainations.

The content are listed below.

L23 Genetic EngineeringQuite good. The instructor explains various biochemical concepts  clearly. Also, you can ask questions during break time and he will answer and solve you enquiries surely. Review sessions are offered before both mid-term and final exams, which give you more information about the upcoming exams and some sample exam questions.The content is pretty easy overall. Don't try to revise all of the content. I don't believe you can recite all ~350 slides. Do the questions from the database. Prof. Qi likes to use those questions in midterm and final exams.

L23 Genetic EngineeringPretty good. His voice would make you laugh your ass off. He has a eunuch voice (Prof. Qi, sorry about that). But he is really helpful if you go and ask him during the break in the middle of his lectures.Learn a lot about the basics of Biochemistry, for example amino acids, nucleic acids, protein structure and function, lipids, carbohydrates, etc.Firstly, I am scared of the course name of biochem because I am a biotech student. But Prof Qi teaches so detailed and he will explain every tiny basic thing clearly in case we forgot the basic concepts.

He will also have a 5-mins short break in the middle of the lesson. And after that he continues with his teaching and it feels so comfortable listening to his lecture. And he keeps all of us writing notes!Covers basics, such as macro molecules, simple reactions, formations and details necessary to understand structure/composition of biological stuff.
Here's a list of things covered (its not ordered, see outline for details):
- Amino Acids, Proteins
- Enzyme Kinetics & Regulation (highlight of the course tbh lol)
- Lipids
- Sugars
- Nucleic Acids
- DNA Transcription/Translation/Synthesis
- Some applications of biochem (working of biotech stuff like
  machines and genetically modified food, for example)
No point in buying textbook unless you are kind that loves to learn by reading. Course content only based on ppt, and prof dedicates a review session each before midterm and final which is good enough.Prof Qi has been one of the best prof I've had the opportunity to be taught from. He spends time to cover all details, does not read from the slides much (which is good and bad, coz then you have to sometimes pay attention to ppt notes and read long paragraphs yourself). Otherwise he likes to discuss some example review questions as well as mention everyday examples.
His accent is a little confusing sometimes, but mostly is perfectly understandable (a rare quality for profs at UST lmao)
He uploads lecture videos, so you can skip classes if you'd want to. I would say you can find other uni lec videos online too if this class doesnt work for you, as content is quite similar around the world for an introductory level biochem course.amino acid, protein structure, protein function and evolution, protein technology, enzyme and enzymatic reaction, enzyme kinetics, enzyme regulation, enzyme cofactor and coenzyme, lipids, biomembrane, carbohydrates, nucleic acid, chromatin structure , dna replication, dna repair and recombination, transcription and rna processing, protein synthesis, genetic engineering.
The topics starting from DNA replication are difficult.There are some learning checks in each lecture to help you study and lecture videos are provided.
There is a break at each lecture.
Professor Qi is nice and approachable, many students ask him questions during the break of each lecture and he is pleased to answer the question.
There were review sessions before mid term and final exam, which are the summary of the exam content and is quite useless i think. But he would finish the slides very quickly and the remaining time is Q&A session. You can ask him questions.Even though this is not a introductory course the content is quite simple. The things are not really complicated and difficult to understand.

Here are the topics that will be covered in the course:
Amino Acids
Protein Structure
Protein Function and Evolution
Protein Technology
Enzymes & Enzymatic Reactions
Enzyme Kinetics
Enzyme Regulation
Enzyme Cofactors & Coenzymes
Lipids
Biomembranes
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates
Nucleic Acids
Chromatin Structure
DNA Replication
DNA Repair and Recombination
Transcription and RNA Processing
Protein Synthesis
Genetic EngineeringThe teaching of the professor is easy to follow and understand. Sometimes, he will ask a few questions before he goes to teach a new topic to check your understanding. His teaching is not bad. However, maybe you will find a little bit uncomfortable with his accent in the first few lessons, but once you get used to it, there is no big deal.The entire course is subdivided into 5 main parts:
- Intro to Biochem (very short)
- Proteins (Amino acids, protein folding, enzymes)
(Mid term)
- Lipids
- Carbohydrates
- Nucleic Acids
(Finals)

At least 60-70% of the Intro, lipids and carbohydrates should already be familiar from high school knowledge. Most students say the protein part is most difficult because there are some equations to remember (not a lot), but overall this course isn't too difficult, I would say it was easier than 1902. The mid-term and final is non-accumulative . Also, the course itself has very clear learning outcomes and presentation, so it was very easy to study for. This course is necessary for all 3 LIFS majors because the information is very useful for each of them.Very good - What I like about his teaching and his lectures is that there are very clear learning outcomes -  it is clear what we need to know. He goes straight to the point and explains things very well. Even though he has a slight accent, his English is very fluent and he seems like he has a lot of years of experience. I highly suggest going to his lectures or watching the lecture videos - it saves you a lot of time because he is addressing a lot of the exam questions indirectly.

Also, he gives a lot of class MCQs in he lecture (usually like in the beginning or end) and they end up being in the exam so it is an added benefit !!!This course talks about the fundamental knowledge of biochemistry including amino acid structure, organic compounds (before mid-term) , lipid and DNA structure (after mid-term). The course content is simple and easy but useful. Just memorize. It is better to go through the textbook.The pronunciation of professor is a bit difficult to hear (but it is common problem of mainland professors). The course material is simple and plain so it does not require detail explanation. So his lecture is not so difficult to understand.Before the midterm the content is about amino acids, protein structures and enzymes and the second part is mainly about lipids, carbonhydrates, DNA and RNA. The content about enzymes and nucleic acids focuses on the mechanisms such as some equations and metabolism processes. On the other hand, the content about other biomolecules requries memorization of the structures and their derivatives, etc.Most of the content can be found in the lecture notes and the teaching gives some explanations. Sometimes the instructor skipped some details but he was willing to talk more after the lectures (those details weren't included in the exams).Foundational contents for any biochemistry/biological science/biotechnology students, covering materials regarding basic biochemicals like proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and DNA.
Truly an epitome of HKUST's life science courses, as all the contents of the course are repeated time and again in other life science course, no matter entry level ones (1902) or higher ones (3140), as if all the things taught by the faculty was organized in a gigantic spiral of knowledge.

To be honest, considering how important this course is for life science students, they should seriously think about changing this to a year 1 course.Robert Qi is a nice professor who would not hesitate to answer your questions. As mainland professors go, his accent is not too difficult to understand, and he compensates for this accent with clear, confident deliveries in his lectures.
Into the later parts of the semester, he would often end the lectures early as there was not a lot of materials to cover.The content are pretty interesting IMO. Mainly focusing on protein folding, amino acids etc. Something worth noting is that at times the content will drill pretty deep.His teaching was okay, however it might be difficult to get used to his accent for the first few lessons, afterwards you will be fine. As for lecturing, he tends to read the PPTS however at times he would make additional comments to specific slides, thus it might worth going through his lectures if you're interested to the topic.The content is not as much complicated; but there are many things for rote-memorization such as amino acids and various types of vitamins.
You get to learn about various biomolecules in basic level including
- proteins / a.a.
- minerals
- lipids
- carbohydrates
plus DNA replication, transcription and translation,
and some basic biotechnologyHe basically follows the powerpoint so there's no need to go to the lecture actually. The lecture video is also uploaded on canvas so you will manage to just look for the video if you feel the lecture note is not enough.
He is quite straight forward, and his pronounciation is quite clear, considering he is a mainland professorBasically about PROTEINS, AMINO ACID, CARBOHYDRATES, DNA etc.
DNA parts are similar to lifs 1902 especially transciption and translation ( overlapping materials)
BUT the concepts are VERY diffcult and theres A LOT TO REMEMBER!!Boring lectures
A bit helpful attending lectures coz prof sometimes will talk about things beyond the ppt but somewhat useful in understanding conceptsThe topics in summer semester would be less than that in Fall or Spring. The content includes: a general picture of Environmental Science, Matter & Energy (Chemistry-related), Biodiversity, Population, Atmosphere, Water Resources, Pollution Problems, etc. The content is fruitful and gives students some basic ideas of Environmental Science. Quite easy for Science students to catch up.

The video project requires students to form a group of 5, producing a 5-mins video about any topic in Environmental Science. There will be a workshop teaching the students how to use Adobe Premiere Pro. Students can borrow equipments from the library for video production (Camera, video recorder, etc.) after joining the workshop. The workshop is quite useful. Common topics of the video project includes food waste, waste treatment and pollution problems. The project will be graded in terms of organization, critical thinking, creativity & teamwork.Prof. Qian: Effective teaching, mainly talks about climate change and different World Climate Conferences.
Exam tips for his part: Doing revision on the PowerPoint slides is enough. Make sure that you are familiar with the focuses and important information about the world conferences.

Prof. Ice Ko: Her English is good and easy to understand. Her teaching is the most interesting part of the course. Make sure you don't use your mobile phone, take photos of her PowerPoint slides and sleep in the lesson. She will ask you questions even if you seat at the back.
Exam tips for her part: Attending all her lectures is important. Take notes on the PowerPoint slides which are not included in your handout. Exam questions would be set on topics being discussed & additional information of the PowerPoint slides in the lesson. She's nice if you are a decent student.

Dr. Cindy Lam: Her PowerPoint slides are too informative that she taught a bit rush. (She promised not to set exam questions on topics that she had no time to teach but finally she set one.)
Exam tips for her part: Attending lectures is useful, a small proportion of exam questions would be set on information given in the lecture. Don't miss the small tables and details in the PowerPoint slides. Her part is the most time-consuming when doing revision because there are so much information that you need to recite. Reading the textbook helps.The topics covered include Biodiversity, Atmosphere, Air and Water Pollution. The topics about conferences and landfill names are extremely boring. This course requires absolutely no understanding and plain memorising about the facts and figures. A nightmare for those interested in learning something from this course. The textbook is not of any use, just memorise the slides.Only Dr. Ice KO's lectures were interesting. There was active class participation and she showed us interesting videos. You have to attend her classes as she discusses slides that will not be shown to us later. Questions from her part are based on these slides and the class discussions. She is very strict, and does not like people using their mobile phones during her teachings.

The lectures of the other three professors are extremely boring. They show no interest in their teaching and can put you to sleep during the classes. Prof. Qian's research may be excellent, but is simply not a good teacher.A lot of content is about basic biology such as biosphere. A lot of the information of the slides are from Wikipedia. Therefore it is not easy for you to memorize everything. The lecture can be quite boring sometimes.The teaching method is quite direct. Mostly is through the usage of Powerpoint. One thing to remember is that some of the contents they mentioned cannot be found on the ppt. Thus it is important to attend every lecture.The teaching content and materials are well-organized and easy to follow in general.
Lecture Topics Include:
- Global environmental challenges (overview of current pressing issues around the world)
- Energy, matter and resource (basic knowledge especially for non-science background ppl)
- Earth Major Biomes (types, distributions, and characteristics of different biomes) (those who like geography might find this topic interesting)
- Biodiversity: significance and threats (with a little case study regarding giant panda)
- Nutrition and food supply (general concepts) (those who studied biology before might have advantage)
- Human Populations (some statistics just for you to understand, least content to memorize)
- Atmosphere and Climate (have to make sure you understand the phenomena like El Nino and La Nina)
- Air Pollution
- Water Resources and pollution
- Wastes and disposal (exams might test on some minor details)Prof. Qian taught only one lesson so I do not have much comment on him.
Prof. Ice Ko was an enthusiastic instructor. She taught in an organized manner and made sure everyone was clear on those important concepts. She would sometimes share with us some thought-provoking quotes, videos and photos. Just make sure you are not attending her class late and do not chat too loud coz she was a bit strict about that.
Prof Cindy Lam took over the class starting from the topic Atmosphere and Climate. She was basically giving out too much information and it is often hard to catch the main point.The content is quite easy, especially if you have taken chemistry or related science subjects in high school. It is an elementary course for environment science so the content are simple.understandable. Be honestly speaking it is not necessary as attendance is not counted. Also, the content are easy so you can self-study them at home. But for Ice KO's class, she will teach something that is not shown in the ppt, and those will appear in the exam. So I do recommend you to go to her class. But other than that, you can choose if you wanna attend the class.No need to buy the text book, but the slides are mainly derived from Cunningham, W.P. and Cunningham, M.A. (2017) Principles of Environmental Science: Inquiry and Applications. Eighth Edition. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Basically just a lot of memorization. But I like science to begin with, and those little fun-facts are interesting (only in my opinion, not the majority though).The four of them are overall boring, but you should definitely come to Ice and Cindy's lectures because they are the ones with the least boring lecture.
Both Ice and Cindy's slides on Canvas are not complete, but Ice doesn't want you to take a photo of her slides during her class, while Cindy seemed fine with it.
What I liked about Dr. Ko’s lecture is she gave quite a lot of case study, and in my opinion it made the lectures more comprehensible and generally easier to memorize.
Prof. Qian may not be the best at teaching, but I can see that he is a great professor with a very deep knowledge on what he's teaching. If you concentrate on what he's saying, you might notice that he repeated the same thing over and over, and that's like a sign that it's going to appear on the exam.
I think Prof. Wang is the worst at teaching, but I would like to give an applause on his very short slides, making my finals a little bit easier. I kinda hate him because he's the one who proposed to make short questions during the final exam. But then again, the purpose of enrolling yourself to a university is to study, so...
Dr. Lam is a very nice person. I think she taught us in the most perfect pace out of the four. She doesn’t have anything particularly interesting about her lectures, but what’s wrong with being a mediocre? :)The content was simple and easy understanding by reading through the notes. People who are with geography and biology background would be advanced.Different teachers have different teaching style. They sometimes provided many pieces of information which are not related to the notes and exam. Quite boring.Lecture Topics Include:
- Global environmental challenges (overview of current pressing issues around the world)
- Energy, matter and resource (basic knowledge especially for non-science background ppl)
- Earth Major Biomes (types, distributions, and characteristics of different biomes) (those who like geography might find this topic interesting)
- Biodiversity: significance and threats (with a little case study regarding giant panda)
- Nutrition and food supply (general concepts) (those who studied biology before might have advantage)
- Human Populations (some statistics just for you to understand, least content to memorize)
- Atmosphere and Climate (have to make sure you understand the phenomena like El Nino and La Nina)
- Air Pollution
- Water Resources and pollution
- Wastes and disposal (exams might test on some minor details)

Most of the content are common sense and the exam is only testing your memorizing ability. Dont take this cc when you are not required.Chinese professors' pronunciation are difficult, if not impossible, to comprehend. And they are just repeating the content on the powerpoints. I slept most of the classes.Largely monotonous, not at all engaging. Requires memorization of lots of obscure statistics. Have to attend all lectures of be willing to read the lecture notes and thoroughly understand the content of each slide. Lecture slides are exceptionally long.Attempted to engage students, but the content was prohibitive to this. Professor would go around engaging students in the back, although they were not paying attention, and had nothing to add.Include biology, chemistry, environment and many other things
Change the exam format suddenly in final exam
Midterm is all MC
One essay with 400 words need to be submittedFine, taught by different professorsIt is a mixture of Biology, Chemistry, Ecology, a bit of Physics and so on. There are a lot of case studies you should remember.

I think this class would be fun as long as you have huge interest in Life Sciences. Other than that, the class may be boring and requires you to memorise a lot. There is no lecture video, so if you wish, bring  your own recording.Ms. Ko Ice is an excellent teacher, but you should not use your phone to take photo of the lecture power points. You have to jot down extra information she provides.

Other teachers are okay; they mostly read the powerpoint.The teaching content and materials are quite general.

They had told you they change video project to an essay on add-drop period ONLY. And then they told you final exam will have "some" short questions in the mid-term period (or after the period? I can't remember.) Where are their responsibility?the content of the course is easy to understand, most of them are just basic knowledge.
Quite boring
no need to take attendanceIce Wai Ping will give some additional information on the lecture that is not written on ppt.
All the instructor's teaching is boring, they are basically reading the ppt, you can just read the ppt by yourself.Areas mainly covered scientific principle of atmosphere, hydrosphere, global warming, solid waste problem, toxicology, over-population issue. All are simple concept, not too hard to understand.Prof. Qian and Wang have some accent, it might be a little bit difficult to listen.The content covers most of the topics in environmental science. However, most of the topics are introduced briefly so that it is hard to get a profound understanding of the concepts in the end. Also, although it is a science school foundation course, this course does not require any background knowledge in environmental science. All you need to get a good grade is reciting all the words on the lecture notes!
To be frank, the content is quite boring, extremely the case study part. The reason for this is that you don't need to analyze the cases by yourselves. They have been analyzed for you and then you have more lecture notes to recite : )Ice KO taught the first two lectures and three lectures immediately after midterm. There was always too much content in her powerpoint for her to finish. Also,  she deleted some important points in the lecture notes uploaded on the canvas so you need to concentrate in the lectures.
Prof Qian just read out his lecture notes. It is not necessary to go to the lectures since his lecture notes contains all the content in the exam.
Prof wang put many pictures without explanation in his powerpoint, but he usually failed to explain these pictures clearly in his lectures. Since the pictures will appear as short essay questions in the final exam, you'd better know about the pictures by searching on the Google.
Cindy LAM just taught the last two lectures. Like Ice ko, her lecture notes contain too much content for her to complete. Many unrelated or weird points will be asked in the final exam so you need to review the lecture notes carefully.
To sum up, none of the instructors teaches very well. Generally speaking, studying by yourself and searching anything you are unclear about are much better than going to the lectures.The content is quite interesting and if you have studied biology before, it will be easier for you as some topics are covered in high school biology already. However, there's still A LOT TO MEMORIZE!!!!I dont really go to lecture as it is sooooooo boring, I think Ice Ko is the only instructor that didnt make me fall asleep but she is very strict, even taking pictures of her slides is not allowedThe course is basically a mix of physics, chemistry and biology, spectrum ranging from energy, nutrition, air pollution to biodiversity. As a student with no science background at all, I was overwhelmed with the range of content covered and find it quite difficult to follow in class, as instructors teach as if you already understand the basic concepts. If you are just looking to fulfil a common core requirement, there are much better courses out there to choose from and you dont have to put yourself into this dire situation.The lecturers in general were boring, I dont know if it's because of the content covered but I just found it uninteresting at all.

For Ice, you need to pay 100% attention and copy a lot of additional slides since she omitted some of the content from her powerpoint slides.

As for Wang, make sure you try to understand what he's trying to say because basically short questions are basically centred around his modules.

Copy a lot of notes for Cindy as well since she tends to elaborate a lot on each slide and provide a lot of additional information.Global warming, biodiversity, water pollution, air pollution, human population...prof Qian teaching is not very clear because of his ascent and the organization of the notes.
The only thing that is good about him is that he will tell you which part is  important  

Dr Lam speaks very slowly and quite soft but she is willing to answer your questions. However, you should do some research online to make sure that you understand the concept because she sometimes make mistake

Ice Ko is the best lecturer of this course. You can easily follow her and the notes are very clear. You must attend her lecture in order to get the full version of her notesTeaches the basics of Environmental Science from biomes, weather systems, pollution, to cooperation between countries against global climate change. Real life examples, Deep Water Horizon for example, are often included for students to understand more about the real-life scenarios. Students may know better about the place they are living in and the recent controversies on climate change.All of the lecturers try grabbing the students attention by raising questions for groups to discuss, although students do not really enjoy participating in... The lecturers like to highlight important parts of the notes or add extra information only on their powerpoint. This may encourage students to attend lectures and make exams fair to those who attend lectures.

In particular, Ice KO has a attention-grabbing voice but Cindy LAM is quite flat-toned (possibly due to the less interesting topics she teaches). They both try to be as informative as possibly and is quite willing to answer questions from students.

QIAN taught only one lecture so I am not so sure if he is good or bad.This course introduces students to the general concepts of environment, natural resources, and sustainable development. The topics include pressing global, regional and local environmental changes; life-supporting systems of our planet; biodiversity and its conservation; the atmosphere, water resources, and their pollutions; solid and hazardous waste management; environmental health and sustainable development. Throughout the course, students will gain a sufficient background and a better understanding of the root-causes of the upfront environmental issues. They will also become more aware of their role, as citizens, in environmental protection and sustainable development.You cannot 100% rely on professor's teaching especially you are not a science student. It takes time to fully understand some important topics like the mechanism of El-Nino or carbon cycle.This course gives an overall picture of environmental science and it almost over all the subjects under this topic.

But general usually means every subject is very rough.

And you have to recite a lot of knowledge to handle the exams.

By the way, the topics of the two exams do not overlap.QIAN, Peiyuan: He only taught us one lecture so I'm not sure.

KO, Ice Wai Ping: every subject she taught was clearly elaborated. But she is strict and treated the students as senior high school students.

LAM, Ka Sin Cindy:  She is very nice but I have to be honest that she didn't explain things well. And her lectures confuse me and bore me.not so much, not that difficult either.kinda waste of time, but takes attendance. So, better not skip any lessons.
In the lessons, theres mainly discussions, MANY discussions.
there'll be bonus points as well if you answer the questions asked by the instructors.The contents are about general concepts of environment, natural resources, and sustainable development. The topics include pressing global, regional and local environmental changes; life-supporting systems of our planet; biodiversity and its conservation; atmosphere, water resources, and their pollutions; solid and hazardous waste management; environmental health and sustainable development.Ice is a wise instructor and put things very clear. Cindy's English is the biggest problem, which is hard to understand very often. Qian only gave one lecture but I can tell he is very knowledge and logical.Like most introduction course especially S&T common core, the content is informative and only focus on some basic knowledge of the environmental science topics. Some topics are cancelled during the summer term, though there are still huge amount of slides to remember. If you attend lectures or at least look through the slides frequently, it will not be too hurry before exams.Ice KO is one of the best lecturers I have ever met in UST. She is relatively strict with students, so you should not play video games on your phone or chat with friends during the class(which should be basic requirements for college students).  Special attention should be paid that she is used to providing some extra contents during the lectures, so make sure you attend the classes on time or remember to copy your reliable friends' notes.
I am not sure whether Cindy is familiar with her content since she frequently loses her minds while teaching and finally turns around to read aloud the slides. Unlike Ice is capable to write clear as well as short slides, Cindy's material is not structured and is full of charts and explanations. It is quite an excruciating work when reviewing her slides. So good luck to her part.- Pressing Global Environmental Issues
- Global Warming and Cooling
- Global Effort in Addressing Environmental Challenges
- Life Supporting Systems
- Hong Kong Environmental Issues

- Wastes and Disposal

etc.

All about the environment. Required to memorize many things.Prof. Qian & Prof. Wang - Super boring. No need to go to class.
Dr. Ko & Dr. Lam - Good. Worth to go to class. Some exam questions are related to what they emphasized during the lecture.For those of you who are not sure what environmental science is, it is a weird mixture of biology, chemistry and geography. There are a lot of things you learn but some of them you can just figure out with your common senses without even studying it properly. And i felt that this course isn't that much about science despite its name.Quite poor. The professors each teach different sections of the courses, but I and my friends soon figured out that most of the lectures are not worth going to. Even if you go to the lectures, you'll see 1/3 of students sleeping and the rest doing something else or procrastinating.

you can still get a fine grade by studying the lecture notes only even if you don't go to the lectures.Environmental issues (e.g. climate change, sewage treatment in Hong Kong, water & air pollution, toxic ...)QIAN taught the first few lectures about global warming, his tone was quite boring but the content was good (he taught some evidence that supported global cooling which was not popular now)

ICE was a very good lecturer, she was well prepared for the lecture and her attitude was very great, she asked questions frequently, I suggest that you must attend her lectures, you can learn a lot from her.

Cindy and Wang's lectures were quite boring, but they always emphasize the key points, if you want to get some tips in revision, you should attend their lectures.They both very nice, questions related to the lecture are welcome.Very General knowledge, not difficult at all
Some notes can be arranged more systematicallyPronunciation of some professors can be improved
I think the teaching sequence and method of professors vary greatly among them
The presentation of info is somehow boring, just like reading powerpointThis course talks about different topic of the environment

The first part mainly talks about the Global environment issues, just like global warming etc. And then it talks about the way that different government to solve the issues.The content is interesting overall. well at least for me.
ppt slides with a lot of text.
ice's lecture must attend, becauseIce is good at teaching but others are just awfulThe grading is not strict. I have to say.
I am on average on both mid term and final and badly on group project.
Got B+.A group project easy to do it as long as you find your trustworthy teammates.
The video project requires students to form a group of 5, producing a 5-mins video about any topic in Environmental Science. There will be a workshop teaching the students how to use Adobe Premiere Pro. Students can borrow equipments from the library for video production (Camera, video recorder, etc.) after joining the workshop. The workshop is quite useful. Common topics of the video project includes food waste, waste treatment and pollution problems. The project will be graded in terms of organization, critical thinking, creativity & teamwork.There are a lot of contents in this class. I personally did not like this class since there are too many things to memorize without any deep understanding about the content.In general, female professors' classes are good but it is hard to understand the pronunciation for the male professors' classes.This course covers a LOT of ground, and for me, a big part of them is not very interesting, but I bet some would find it more engaging. Also, since this course is given by multiple instructors, I think the course isn't thought out as a whole from the very beginning, and it shows in the course material. Exam covers literally everything covered, including the specific location of a waste processing plant in Hong Kong and the exact date of some conference decades ago. Depending on who you are, the content would range from horrendously boring to very informative.Personally I skipped most lectures, so I don't have much to say about teaching. If you have the determination to spend a few days going over all the slides prior to mid-term and final, skipping all the lectures is definitely doable.The content of this course is quite board including some environmental issues, biodiversity, population and etc.No CommentThe grading is good, about mean with half to one sd in the midterm and final exam would likely to get an A in this course.The workload of this course is fair, just midterm, final and project. Midterm and final are multiple choice which is easy to handle.   
Project is a 5-min video clip and you can choose any topic that is related to environmental science. It is suggested that to find a few of reliable friends to form a group.The content was rather broad, allowing us to learn a rather wide scope of knowledge. The course was split into four different sections; in which each section had its own specific kind of topic, e.g. Biodiversity, Urban Problems, Global Warming and Energy.
We got to know a lot of technical terms, theories, reasons and impacts of all these issues.As the course was "split into" four different sections, there were different professors coming in; sometimes there were videos etc.
Different professors had different styles, totally different styles. But we could tell that each professor is highly knowledgeable in the field / section that he / she is specialized in. You could see the passion and also the knowledge that they possess.Personally, I do not like environmental science, so I cannot comment on the content. Science part is, if you are majoring in science or have some basic knowledge, super easy. O3, CO2, ozone, global warming those kind of stuff, really basic. But it might take some time to make yourself familiar with those terms if you are not science major. What I do not like was everything else came after the science part.  Bunch of statistics, memorizing stuff, where the conference was held and bla bla. It's just stuff that you need to memorize. I don't see the point of memorize percentages, but they do come up on the exam so.....I wanted to give D but Ice KO was really good at teaching, so gave C.

Ice KO
Her voice is really clear, easy to understan. I suggest attend her lecture as she post slides that are not on the Canvas. She is really sensitive students using phones in the lecture and she really do humiliate the student in front of 400 people, so just be careful of that.

Cindy
Ohhhhh... her lecture was sooooooo boring but you need to go to the class as she emphasizes some things that will come up in the exam. I thought her part was evil becuase she throws lots of statistics questions at the final exam.

QIAN
his lecture was okay. Not hard to understand but he likes to turn the light off during the lecture so quite a lot of people doze off in last 30min.

Wang
Boring. Lecture slides are enough for revisingthe content of the course is kind of separated and the contents are sometimes not shown on the slides so the past paper is very important when it comes to preparing for the test, apart from that, they might include something sounds extremely complicated without even explaining it, so it is very important to let go some of the less meaningful parts.Prof. QIAN was very nice and his way of teaching is more organized, others are fine, but some of their accents really take time to understand.A combination of geography, biology, chemistry, history.Not very attractive.It depends on how much ppt you can memorize. Most  of answers to the exam questions  can be found on ppt. There were some really detailed questions about a certain meeting or the content of a graph . If you are good at memorizing and very careful, you can get a good grade.
MY GRADE: midterm: mean
                     final: over ten points higher than mean
                     video: 20 out of 30
                    total:B+No assignment, no attendence. A five minutes video. But too much ppts and too detailed  questions were asked in exams. Need around three to four days to go through the notes.The content was quite rich but quite a number of memorization was needed, for example you need to know what kind of rubbish takes up the greatest proportion of municipal solid waste.One professor is particularly boring...nearly fell asleep
But others were okayThe content was straightforward. There were relatively a lot to memorize. You have to attend the lectures because the professor gives hints about which questions come up on the examsThe teaching was ok. However, at times it was hard to focus because the professor's voice was monotone.It is not a hard course as i have studied biology and geography in HKDSE. It's like a summary of these two subjects. If you have studied the two subjects before, the content being covered is really simple. You don't have to worry about it, unless you just study the basis in these two subjects. You need to study the extension part in the two DSE subject in order to understand the course material thoroughly.I highly appreciated Dr. Ko and Prof. Qian. They will try to explain each concept in detail. Though the number of powerpoint pages of Prof. Qian is really numerous, it's not hard to understand if you have attend the lectures. Yet, for Dr. Lam and Prof. Wang, they are really poor when comparing with Dr. Ko and Prof. Qian. You cannot get any point even you attend the lectures.The syllabus includes a wide range of topics which are interesting and fundamental. Instructors use a lot of daily examples such as news and video clips to enrich the lecture content and deepen students' understanding. For a 2.5hour lecture in summer semester, the time passes fast especially in Ice Ko's lecture. You can earn a lot of common sense through this course.Ice Ko prepared well for her lecture but she always overrun. Cindy seems like not being familiar with her ppt and simply read out the slides as well as playing a lot of videos. Sometimes students ask questions but she is not able to answer. QIAN throws a lot of complicated concepts within short time that is hard to follow.Topics covered were not really interesting. A couple are really stupid, as you have to memorise a lot of environmental conferences and location of landfills in Hong Kong (yes those came out in the exams)Horrible. Qian maybe is incredible in research, but he dowright sucks in teaching. Don't get me started with Lam and Wang. Ice Ko was the only one decent there.This course introduces students to the general concepts of environment, natural resources, and sustainable development. The topics include pressing global, regional and local environmental changes; life-supporting systems of our planet; biodiversity and its conservation; atmosphere, water resources, and their pollutions; solid and hazardous waste management; environmental health and sustainable development. Throughout the course, students will gain a sufficient background and a better understanding of the root-causes of the upfront environmental issues. They will also become more aware of their role, as citizens, in environmental protection and sustainable development.Very very boringMainly basics about environmental conditions and how we are affecting them.Lectures were quite boring. Did not attend many but still managed to understand information from lecture slides.Easy A as long as you read the slides and do well in the video required. Exams do not need much studying. reading slides once will suffice. Exams are all mcq and some answers are quite obvious if you read the lecture slidesMinimal workload, the only real workload being the video. Group work seems to be the main problem if you get stuck with free ridersI skipped almost all the lessons except the lesson taught by Ice KO. The content of her video could be the questions in exam. She taught some current issues about global environment which is quite useful.As the content mentioned, I only attended Ice KO's lessons. No mobile phone, computer is allowed in the lessons. And, she walked around sometimes to ask students questions.Topics include environmental problem and basic bio concepts.
The content are rather interesting, providing some fundamental knowledge about the earth and also the problem we are facing right now.Ice ko is crazy but her teaching is good. There are around 40 TAs during the midterm LOL

Cindy is nice,
The other two are very boring.It was a nightmare. The course has many overlapping content. Waste management was clearly an overlapping topic over all instructors lecture slides. Contents have been repetitive which demonstrates poor coordination and liaison of such course. Only the 1/3 of the course is of clear structuring, remaining are clearly of chaos.Majority of the instructors do not have good presentation skills. Worse off is some couldn't deliver contents without hesitations or in fluent English. Organization and timing of lectures may be an apparent problem as the instructors usually found problems to cover the pre-designated content under the planned timeline. Teaching are generally below average when comparing to other Common Core courses.not very usefulThe content covers a wide range of diseases. Each disease is not taught very deeply, just briefly introduce is clinical manifestation and treatment. However, sum up there will be a lot to memorize. I am overwhelmed when studying the final exam. You will find the course interesting if your enjoy studying stuff related to disease or human body.XIA Jun is a very good professor. His teaching is fun. He likes to tell stories of how the disease or how the treatment was discovered, which made the lesson less boring. He can also provoke the students to think more about the experiment part on how to study a disease or how the disease is discovered instead of just memorize all the existing know ledges.Topics:

MIDTERM:
Introduction and a brief history of disease and medicine
Neurological diseases (Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases)                                        
Psychiatric diseases (schizophrenia, depression and Autism)

FINAL:
Cardiovascular diseases (hypertension and coronary heart disease)
Endocrine disorders (diabetes)
Gastrointestinal diseases (peptic ulcers)
Infectious diseases (AIDS and Flu/Cold)
Cancer

Topics are extremely interesting. Provides a decent, comprehensive overview of all the common diseases.

The structuring of the topics is quite messed up. There are basically just 2 topics for the midterm, which are relatively easy ones as well. But the final has 5 topics, all very long and complex. If 1 or 2 topics are moved from the final to midterm it would be more balanced. Otherwise the final is too difficult to prepare for.Excellent professor. Explains every topic in detail and very clearly. Interactive, always asking questions in class, and sometimes funny. Helpful and responsive to any questions.

The lecture notes uploaded online are extremely detailed with 100+ slides for each topic.• Neurological diseases (Alzheimer’s diseases, Parkinson’s Diseases)
• Psychiatric diseases (schizophrenia, depression and Autism)
• Cardiovascular diseases (hypertension and coronal heart disease)
• Endocrine disorders (diabetes)
• Gastrointestinal diseases (peptic ulcers)
• Infectious diseases (AIDS and Flu/Cold)
• Cancer

He is trying to teach a lot to us by giving a lot of details of biochemical substances, which is acceptable for me, but maybe too harsh for some who do not like memorising.
He gives extra cases for us too in lecture notes. (Ebola, which is not in syllabus and he does not test it in any exam)

This course is quite funny if you like medical stuffs, which is not so many in hkust.
Personal suggestion: take this to learn a little bit cancer and decide if you will take personalized medicine or cancer biology. I think this course gives a quick brief of them.The accent of the instructor is so terrible that i can hardly follow what he is talking to us.
Maybe he knows that so he type everything in the lecture notes, so you can just skip all the classes and memorise it all.

The instructor is really experienced. He is a really certificated medical officer, so u can ask him when you want diagnosis. And that is why he sometimes get too much out of the lecture, giving too much infomationBefore mid term : History, neurological disease
After mid term : Heart disease, Diabetes, Peptic ulcers, Cancer and infectious disease

Actually it may not that related to the course title, because apart from the neurological diseases, biochemistry pathway is not that emphasized in the other topics. It contains a lot of medicines and yes you have to remember the principles and the name of the medicines. For me it's not that difficult to understand and memorize. After mid-term there will be more details in pathway and medicines of the diseases but still can handle. Sometimes he gave a lot of details but mainly will not be tested.Xia Jun is a nice and good professor, he talked appropriate amount of the content and the ratio of the time he spent on specific part to the exam ratio is almost 1:1, so you should give attention to the content that he talked for longer time, except for the story of the winner of nobel prizes. He spent a lot of time to talk about the scientific investigation and principles of the discovery, it is interesting to listen and know but it would not be tested in the exam.See the attachment :)Prof. Ko teaches with passion and interest, so he sometimes talks some topics that are not included in the syllabus or exam. But he tells the students that which type of information will not be on the exam which is very helpful.
His powerpoints are very concise and short with quite a lot of diagrams, so it is recommended to watch the lecture video or attend the lecture. Also, professor asks students to understand not memorize, but personally I think it requires memorization. It is impossible to memorize the whole metabolism of molecules, but some names are important in the exam.
His accents are sometimes quite hard to understand but acceptable. He uploaded all the lectures in my semester, but understanding what professor is saying through the video is harder than actually going to the lecture due to background noise.I would say this course has a lot more content than a lot of Life Science courses, but it is definitely the highlight for anyone doing the BCB Major. In my semester the order of topics were:
1) Energetics and basics of biochemistry
2) Glycolysis
3) Citric Acid Cycle
4) ETC
5) Pentose Phosphate Pathway
6) Gluconeogenesis and Glycogen metabolism
7) Lipid metabolism
8) Nitrogenous compounds
9) Nucleotide metabolism
10) Integration of metabolism
11) Extracellular regulation (aka signalling)

Each topic can go in a lot of depth, but what is good about this course is that you ONLY focus on what the professor has mentioned in the lecture (there is NOTHING in the exam which requires outside reading), and definitely focus on what the professor keeps emphasising and repeating.A majority of the course was taught by Robert Ko (except lipid metabolism), and honestly one of the best professors in Life Science. He teaches with a lot of enthusiasm and passion, explains the powerpoint in great detail, and he relates a lot of the knowledge to a wider perspective like weight loss, exercise, and diseases. The guest professor for lipid metabolism is quite similar, but he only teaches 3 lectures.

Exam-wise, whatever both professors mention in class is more than enough for exam revision, so I suggest reviewing all the lectures either by being present or watching it in Canvas. If they repeat certain concepts a couple of times in class this concept is for sure going to be examined.The content isn't that difficult, it is just that there are lots of concepts to memorize from, not necessarily understanding. The contents of the course are simple and give a basic knowledge of carbohydrates, nitrogenous compounds, and lipids.Explains every single powerpoint slide with great detail and gives out additional information that can be applied in our daily life. He introduces other Life Science teacher to teach part of syllabus where he thinks they will explain the syllabus in a better way than he will, so I think this will be beneficial for us.
Skipping a few classes may not be a problem as the lectures are uploaded in Canvas.Basically everything you would ever want to know about microbiology
and... things you might not want to know as well
like all the defining features of microbes
the diseases (with photos) associated with them
the antimicrobial drugs
how to make cheese
etc

Very helpful if you want to learn how microbes play a role in public health or in... daily life, really. Banfield tries to make the course relatable to general citizens (as shown by the extra slides that tell you what the chapter will teach general citizens). He puts special emphasis on how the microbes interact with you.

For detailed listing see attachmentOh Prof. Banfield... I guess his teaching style is just very controversial.
Some people may say he's very mean and vengeful because of what they did to him (and how he responded) in Fall 14/15 Cell Biology. But like, if you're a decent human being, you'll think he's a fair and predictable person that won't take your bullshit. Is he sarcastic? Yes. But is he fair in his teaching, exam question setting and in his character? Yes (his exam questions aren't easy, but if you studied you'd do decently well -- there are always a few questions that come out of nowhere but that's just him trying to distinguish between the top students; nothing to do with the general crowd since no one can get the questions anyway and so the curve is just skewed lower).
To me, his sarcasm does not really deter me in an academic setting. I think it's his way of being an interesting human being (versus a boring, reading off the slides professor that you'll hate a lot more). Prof. Banfield is a typical Canadian -- funny and sarcastic (and he does like to make fun of his American "friends down South"). And in class, his character can translate into a lot of jokes and a less boring lecture. Not sure if the jokes are intentional, but his character definitely makes me enjoy class a lot more.
If you have questions/issues, you can definitely email him or ask him after class. He really cares about his students and tries as much as he can to help if they have problems. I've emailed him about a lot of issues and he kindly helped me through all of them.
If you want to talk about your exams, you can also just email him and set up a time. He'll be happy to talk about what you did wrong and how you can improve.
(side note: I guess that's why he was so angry about the Fall 14/15 incident anyway. If you have a problem, he would be happy to discuss it with you. That's how he functions. You don't bitch about him behind his back.)

Jessica is pretty normal as everyone says... Teaches to the slide, gives relatively easy, straight-off-lecture-slides exam questions. Her LearnSmart assignments were also a lot lighter compared to Banfield's.
Jessica is very approachable if you have questions. She's such a sweetie pie.Introduction to microbiology, Bacteria, Fungi/Protists and Viruses are taught by Banfield.

All the other intensive topics are taught by Jessica.First nine lectures are taught by Banfield. The rest 14 lectures are taught by Jessica.

Banfield's teaching is interactive and interesting with little content on the slides. If you talk a lot during class, you might embarass yourself in front of the whole lecture theatre. If you leave in the middle of the lecture, he will make fun of you. So, you better think before you act.

Jessica's teaching covers every point on the slide which can get boring and confusing.Intensive and wide course, it touched upon a lot of important topics related to microbiology. Most of the topics were very detailed, each lecture had 80-120 slides. A lot of information to process, its a little overwhelming.Professor Banfield was excellent, one of the best lecturers I've had so far. Very engaging and enjoyable lectures.
After the midterm we had Professor Tang who was great as well, but not as engaging as the previous lecturer.
Overall, the teach was great for the amount of information the course had.Before midterm:
Basic knowledge about microbes, such as bacterial and viral structure, growth and metabolism of microbes. Useful.

After midterm:
Focus on human diseases and immunity. Some experiments to identify microbes types are included.Zeng taught before midterm. He only read out ppt almost without any additional information. teaching style was so boring.

Jessica  taught after midterm. She also read out ppt and jumping so fast. Many of her ppt slides are useless, and she sometimes showed some irrelevant videos and pictures and tried so hard to make students laugh. But no one laughed except her.
But she is very willing to answer students question.Asking questions can learn deeper than just understanding the slide. If you are Cantonese speakers, it will be very good to ask her questions after lectures as she speaks Cantonese.Before mid-term, the content is fair with 10 chapters of PPT to study. It mainly focus on how to distinguish different kinds of bacteria etc. However, after mid-term, with ONLY 12 chapters which each of them contain 100 pages. If you can recite all of the names of bacteria, diseases or founders, go for it, this subject is good for you.First part of the course was taught by prof. ZENG, his voice is so soft that it is a good chance for everyone to sleep at 9am. For the second part of the course, prof. TANG, I don't like her much because she is annoying and teach the PPT as fast as she can.Part 1 (Taught by Prof. Karen Chan)

(* All chapters taught by Dr. Ice Ko will include mathematical models, but you don't have to do the math in final exam)I think two professors have totally different teaching style.

Prof. Karen Chan put more emphasis on interaction between students, she starts lectures with a few iPRS questions to see if students understand what is previously taught. She speaks really fast but students can still catch the stuff up as she will stop sometimes to check whether students understand what she's talking about. I like her little gags and her enthusiasms of teaching.

Dr. Ice Ko is really a different story, if you really know her, you will know it's her typical teaching style. She really cares about how much did the students absorb from her, she will explain things in detail procedures. To be honest, she is not bad compared to those professors who are really boring. She speaks clearly and a lot of my friends, include me, all agree that it is more easier for them to catch the course materials from Ice's courses. She could be strict sometimes of course. However, despite of this, she is a nice instructor who is willing to answer students' questions.

In general, both professors are not bad and teach students with totally different teaching styles.Dr. Ko: Interaction between different species
Prof. Yau: Information of ecosystem and the intraspecific behaviorDr. Ko used so many BBC documentaries to grab our attention which most of them are surprisingly interesting. Her ppt is clear and easier to understand. Concept she taught is also simple. Her summary tables is so organised and useful but you need to jot them down on your own as her ppt is different to the one you received.

Prof. Yau ppt is more informative and not that easy to understand if you ditch the classes. As she did so many researches, she has millions of stories to tell which make her lessons more engrossing. Her British accent is so sweet which is also an attractive point ( > v ‧ ).I'm going to give you a little tl;dr of my review for lazy asses out there:
Karen was fucking praise-the-lord amazing, Ice was drop dead terrible.

Karen legitly goes through the syllabus, so if you wanna know what she'll be lecturing on go have a quick skim through the textbook (it's available online). Her content is great, it's useful and interesting and by the time she's done nobody is confused.

Ice Ko is obviously clueless at what she's teaching and essentially reads off the textbook. When she isn't, she's either (a) showing us pointless videos of David Attenborough (she's either fucking him or a prospective leader of his fanclub) or (b) asking us if we understand an utterly moronic concept. On the syllabus it all looks fine and dandy (because Karen wrote the syllabus) but she actually only manages to go through about 3 topics out of 13 because she spends 3 classes on a single mathematical equation.Karen goes at a hundred miles per hour which I'm fine with, because at least nobody falls asleep. That having been said, she's good at making everybody understand stuff though, so kudos to her. Responds to feedback, because she has a Q&A section on iPRS before every class and goes through questions people have.

Ice is well, a fucking bitch. There's no other way of describing her, I'm sorry - she could be a preschool teacher (I was being nice, she resembles a preschooler more than a teacher tbh)
1. She screams at people for coming in the wrong door
2. She screams at people for being 2-20 minutes late (length of tantrum depends on her mood)
3. She stops, goes dead quiet and stares at you until you reach your seat. Then she says in an ominous voice "Please see me after class"
(Who the fuck does she think she is, the Pope?)
I went to every single one of Karen's classes and maxed out the midterm, and skipped every single class of Ice Ko's. If it weren't for Karen I would have given teaching an E.Very interesting course. It is unique compared to other LIFS courses because there are case studies involving research papers. Once in a while you have to read a paper and that paper would be discussed in class. I found this really useful. The core content itself is also very interesting, you would learn everything from biodiversity, competition, predation, statistics, evolution, genetics and reproduction.Karen is brilliant --- can't say less than that. Hands down the best instructor of my 5 semesters in HKUST. Her English is fluent, clear and crisp. She asks loads of questions and she tries her best to make sure students understand her. She's a bit fast and she covers A LOT of content so you might struggle to catch up to her pace.
Stanley on the other hand, is very slow and mild. He's also good and engaging in class, very clear and friendly in person.Dr. Ice Ko's
Interaction between different populations

Dr. Cynthia Yau's
Background information about EcologyBoth lectures are very good

Dr. Ice Ko would show video in lectures, allowing us to understand the real world of ecology and she would not rush in class, ensuring that most of the students understand the concept

Not so hard to follow... Personally I felt this course is pretty easy. Memorization and understanding are both important in this course.Dr. Ko has a strong voice, so it is easy to concentrate on her lecture. Dr. Yau has a softer voice compared to Dr. Ko, but she has articulate pronunciations, so the class is not boring. The two are quite different but both are good professors who are open to students' questions.Topics:

Extremely interesting and fun topics. Excellent structure, organized, with case studies, videos, etc.Karen is brilliant, one of the best professors at UST. I recommend taking her Ocean Science class as well. Interesting, funny, interactive, explains very clearly (although she goes super fast), and lecture notes are good.

Ice can sometimes be too strict about stupid things like entering class late, which shouldn't really matter at college. Her lectures are decent, not as fun as Karen's. Lecture notes are excellent.

Both the professors' lecture notes are enough for revision, and there is no need to attend any lecture. But Karen's lectures are so good it's worth attending even at 9 am.All the concepts and ideas included in this course are applicable to real life science and provided with examples.
I personally enjoyed the course a lot. The instructors demonstrate impressive teaching by truly preparing every next lecture depending on students feedback on previous lecture.
There also plenty of video watching and analysing in lectures that students can see how the theories are really happening in real life.Both instructors are very patient and give awesome lectures that are able to intrigue students' interest in the topic. They both are very friendly and nice that there are always a line of students asking questions after each lecture. The atmosphere in class is superb that are interactions among instructor and students.A great course. The concepts were very well-taught. The lectures were very engaging and the videos shown helped understand the concepts better. Once in a while, we were asked to read case studies, which were research papers. These were not difficult to read and very interesting. Class discussions were based on these.
The materials covered were predation, parasitism, competition, commensalism, Shannon Index, Mate competition, and other aspects of animal behaviour.The teaching was excellent. Karen explained the concepts clearly and in very good English. She always focussed on understanding of the concepts and not about memorisation.
Stanley was a funny instructor. He explained the concepts in a simple manner that every student in class could understand.Content was great. Very interesting concepts were taught in class. Class content is very applicable to any human or animal behaviour you may observe. Content is decent for the midterm and final.The teaching done by both professors is interesting. Both professors have different styles of teaching however the style drew my attention in class.Karen:

ParasitismI truly enjoy the teaching style of Karen. She is eloquent and what she taught was very informative and interesting to me. I know that some found her pace too fast but to me it's appropriate. Very seldom can you find a lesson hooking, be it ruined by the terrible English or the poor presentation skills of the lecturers. Karen has neither of those problems. However, being an elite like her, she expects more from students-- more interactions and faster responses. She was disappointed when the class didn't participate actively enough, and could get a bit moody sometimes.
As for Ice, the content she taught was much easier and more direct compared to that of Karen. She did present the content clearly but in a really slow pace. I felt that I could just read the content at home without attending the lessons since the content didn't need much explanation except for the mathematical models. Personally, I prefer Karen to Ice.Similar to what was being taught in HKDSE syllabus, including:
- basic characteristics of life (the chemistry of life, cells)
- vital life processes (respiration, photosynthesis, genetics)
- essential concepts of evolution and ecology
Overall, the content and concepts are not really difficult but you must spend time in understanding them in order to have good performance.

50% for both midterm and final

For the last two topics, you better memorize the category of biological entity. They will be examined in the final.I will give a C for Raymond Wong's teaching and an A for Eugene Hung's teaching. I can sense that Raymond Wong was a knowledgeable person and know a lot of things, but he tended to discuss things out of the syllabus and I found it difficult to chase up.

Eugene Hung is a good lecturer. He will explain the concepts in  a way that you can easily understand and even answer the questions if you paid enough attention.Before the midterm (taught by Wong):
Chemistry of living things, cell theory, energy (ATP) and cellular respiration

Post-midterm by Hung:
Cell division, DNA & genetics, ecology
which I thought were much harder, especially DNA & genetics

If you aren't going to study life sciences, or you know nothing about biology, I think it would be a better idea to take 1030 or 1930 instead.I never went to the lectures. But they were video recorded and uploaded to Canvas.

It could be that the lectures were boring, or maybe I just didn't like biology.Extremely terrible introductory course...I have no background in Biology but the course starts with DNA RNA synthesis...I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A CELL IS!!

If you don't have any knowledge in biology and you are not interested in it...DONT TAKE THIS COURSE! Mechanisms not explained, concepts not explained but required you to recite and know how to use it...LOL what?Boring..not quite organised....unreasonably difficult as an introductory course...I asked a friend who got 5* in biology saying that this course is crazily difficult coz you entered the realm of DSE electives in the first month of study already.Part I: Organization of Life

Easy to fall asleep but need to take iprs.
Try not to sleep in Jessica Classes because you can prepare the iprs questions before class. You need to be quite in Tye lesson or she will stop teaching.Part I: Organization of Life

Part I and part II are just about memorizing powerpoint slides. Part III requires more time as u need to understand some important concepts like the different  DNA technologies, as well as how inheritance work etc....I personally found it boring.The teaching only consists of reading the slides. Part I and Part II are taught by prof Tang which is boring but every information you need to know in the exams are on her slides. Part III is taught by prof Tye, her teaching is slightly less boring than prof Tang but her slides are basically 30% of what you are supposed to know in exams. You need to do research with her slides as they provide very superficial understanding of each topic/concept.Part I: Organization of Life

It's interesting to look into the mechanism of organisms, but there are really too many vocabs to memorize lol.
In this course, although it's sometimes just like a skim, you are able to understand the concepts of some genetic diseases and biotechnology.Professor Tang and Professor Tye are both knowledgeable and good at teaching.
However, due to some unknown reasons, the class seems to be noisy all the time. Professor Tye usually stops lecturing and reminds us to focus on the important concepts.
Thanks Professor Tye a lot for providing a nice learning atmosphere!If you have done IB, it is a mix of HL and SL IB. Before mid term you do mainly animal cells and plant cells. After mid terms you do DNA, cell replication and some biotechnology and evolution. The content is not cumulative, so whatever is testes in mid term won't come for final.Very bad, and very boring. The worse is there is PRS quiz which counts to 10% of your grade so you can't skip and lectures. Tang slides were good, but tye slides were horrible. I would recommend watching online videos and online lectures as they were more useful for me then anything I did in the lecture. Take some sort of entertainment in the lecture so you don't get bored.Basic biology knowledge, covering the syllabus of HKDSE Biology.Miss Tang has a relatively flat intonation, which made me feel sleepy all the time, so the lesson could be quite boring and the delivery of the biology knowledge was room for improvement.
Miss Tye has a better intonation. But still, sometimes she didn't give adequate concise explanation during teaching.TANG:

Can't understand what they are teaching.
You have to rely on yourself.Basic characteristics of the cell, photosynthesis and cellular respiration, cell division, DNA, Variety of life, the evolution of life... etc.

The content is various and kind of interesting, especially for the DNA part. And all the content are understandable. Lecture video is uploaded. Just watching them repeatedly can help you get a good grade.Professor HUNG is VERY GOOD.

He is willing to answer any question. And even you ask him in the e-mail, he will explain in detail. Besides, he is willing to see the contribution in this course, so BOUNS MARK is given to those who ask meaningful questions, and who contribute to the online discussion.

He explains every part thoroughly, which makes us easily to understand(memorize) the content.- The study of life

A lot of things to memorize, but acceptableDr. Tang has a unique accent, so sometimes it is hard to understand what she's saying. Prof. Tye is good at English, but her teaching is a bit boring. Actually there is no reason to go to the lecture (except for the clicker questions) because you can catch up with everything if you read the textbook and lecture notes.Content is not that hard to understand. It is available to study without attending lecture, only with books. However, it may take some time until fully understanding it and memorising the contents well for exam.No CommentA lot of things are covered in this course. Not so hard to understand and catch up the class if you read textbook. It gets hard and really need to revise with the textbook when you start learning DNA technology.The professor is really nice but couldn't handle the crowds making noise. All the things the professor teaches are from the textbook.The content was very broad and we had to learn in detail for each topic. The content includes classification of organisms, cells and structures, chemistry of nutrients, mitosis and meiosis, evolution, etc.Professor Tang and professor Bik Tye had very different lecturing style. Professor Tang was very generous for those students who were chatting during the lecture, but professor Bik Tye did not allow students to chat each other during her lecture at all. Their lecture notes (PPT and PDF) were very helpful in understanding the lecture.Learn basic knowledge of biology.
Covers AS content in GCE/IAL and IB SL Biology so it is good to have background knowledge of them. It might be difficult if you didn't study biology for a long time.Professor Jessica had relatively appropriate lecture notes compared to Professor Bik.
Not enough information presented in the lecture notes so a lot of self-study required. The textbook has enough information to cover mid-term and final exam.Syllabus:

-FINAL-I would give C for Prof. Tang. She's basically reading her powerpoint during the lecture. I went to the class only because I have to answer the in class clicker question.

I would give A for Prof. Tye. Though all the topic she taught have been covered in my high school years, I still learned something in her lecture. In my opinion, she taught really good.Prof Tang covers most of the stuff taught in DSE biology while Prof Tye covers most of the stuff taught in IB.
Prof Tang teaches before mid term while Prof Tye teaches after mid term. The final exam will only cover Prof Tye's lectures.

Prof Tang:
1. The Study of Life
2. The Chemical Basis of Life
3. Molecules of Life
4. Cell Structure and Function
5. Biological membrane
6. Energy and Enzymes
7. Cellular Respiration

2. Mendelian inheritance
3. Non-mendelian inheritance
4. DNA-the Genetic Material
5. DNA replication
6. Translation of the genetic code
7. Gene regulation
8. DNA Technology
9. EvolutionThe teaching is quite boring. I don't usually listen to the professor. But the powerpoint prepared by both professors are really clear and well-organized.It is not a difficult course but you have to remember a lot of things.Two professors are there, Herrup is the better one and I like his lesson more.I am below mean in the mid term for about 5 points , mean is about 70% in mid term
I got 80% in final exam and I didn't know the mean score.
Finally I got a B.There is no assignment, the only thing about this course are mid term and final exam. You have to revise for about 2 days to get a good grade in each of them.Similar to DSE biology, but some of contents are more difficult. As a introductory course, it is very difficult for those did not learn biology before. The content:
cell structure,respiration,genetics,evolution and so on.The professors make the lesson boring. I think they expect the students have taken biology before, so they taught really fast.
Fortunately, the ppt are quite well-organised although it is not enough to just study them and go to exam.The course is split between 2 profs, and clicker questions will be asked in EVERY lecture. despite only counting 85% of the clicker questions, not much students can get full score from that.Prof Tang teaching was quite boring. Her explanation was quite difficult to understand and always makes broken gag all the time. Not an enjoyable lecture.
Prof. Tye was passion about teaching, and at least she tried to give us interesting video, which I still don't like but if you are interested in biology then you will get into it. Nevertheless the content and explanation of Prof Tye was rich.Similar to 11th and 12th grade biology. Actually this course partially covers Lessons 1 to 15 of the Pearson Life Science book, divided into 3 parts:
1. Organization of Life
2.Energy Transfer Through Living Organisms &
3. Continuity of Life/DNA the blueprint of life

It is said to read the book along with the lectures. (they make us purchase ebook, sharing is best, 328 HKD per ebook, just share)

I just used the end of chapter review sections, because I am not much keen to learn Life Science, but I have some interest in understanding and appreciating it.
(No online assignments, use of ebook is just to read the book, it also provides extra questions to practice which are sometimes nice, I didn't used them)Difficult to comment, Both Professors try to create some interest, but it seemed (to me) that they have assumed that we are going to take LIFS as our major. So I attended all the lectures (otherwise it is difficult to catch up, as I am not a easy to learn without understanding well type person).
For me teaching was fine enough (by both Professors).Quite easy even for those with no bio backgrounds.

Contens :Chemistry of living things, Cell theory, Energy and cellular respiration, Mitosis, Meiosis, Classification of living thingsI didn't usually attend the lectures but was able to catch up with all the contents as all the lecture videos were uploaded on the Canvas.Pretty standard stuff that you would think someone doing biology would definitely know. Areas such as:

- Chemistry of living things
- Cell theory
- Energy and cellular respiration
- Mitosis
- Meiosis
- Classification of living things

are all covered in this course. If you have done biology at secondary school level or high school level, these topics should sound pretty familiar to you. In terms of content wise, this course is actually pretty decent.Teaching is decent for Prof Hung. He knows what he is teaching and he tries to make sure that he explains things in a manner which it is pretty understandable. If not for the fact that the lectures were in the morning, he should have a lot more students attending his class.

Prof Wong definitely knows his things, but he likes to bring in things that don't really have much relation to what we learn, and it kinda makes people not want to listen to him since it's hard to discern what is useful from what he says. Also, the fact that the examination set by this professor is almost identical to the questions from the textbook, which makes listening and learning in his class pretty much useless.Teaches various fundamental life science, particularly focusing on molecular biology part. Complies with 1000-level course difficulty, not so challenging, but those who have little basis on biology may find the course content cumbersome.It's true that 9am courses are often physically demanding and LTA is the worst place to pay attention to the lecturer. Still, I felt extremely bored during the courses of both professors, cant help marking C for the section.
Happened to learn some biology before the semester, so I'm not so sure how effective teaching styles of lecturers were to biology-newbies.Lot of Chemistry contained, very easy if you have chemistry background, especially prior to the midterm. After mid-term there is more biology and you will need to memorize few things, however if you did some biology in high school you will know most of them (DNA, Transcription, Translation etc.)Teaching is OK but little bit boring, presentations are posted online and lecture videos also. The teacher will also recommend a a book, which I recommend to get. The questions for midterm exams were mostly taken from the book.Basic theories of Life science
It says that you don't need any background knowledge
with biology, but it is recommended to have some as the class goes quite fast.
But it is boring such as most of the life science courseI would give C for Raymond WUNG and B for Eugene HUNG, but don't want to give B, so C.

WUNG just repeats what is on the text book. He follows exactly the flow of textbook. His way of explaining is very boring and very often he talks about issues not related with the syllabus. Absolutely no need to attend his lecture, nor look at his slide if you have the text book.

HUNG was better than WUNG. He does follow the textbook but he skips a lot of things in the textbook so I do not recommend to study the final with the textbook. His slide is also quite well made. But boring in general.Mid-term: DSE syllabus + limited extra information
Final: Simple and basic concepts as well as processes of genetics.Professor Hung's teaching is really very good. You will regret not to attend his lessons. He teaches for final for my semester.I was above mean 0.5-1 SD for both mid-term and final. I still got an A for my total score.Not much. There is a so-called individual project for the final exam. Yet, it could be finished in 30 minutes by following the sample and guidelines given by professor Hung.General content of Biology for students without Biology background. Including chemical basis of life, cell structure and function, cellular respiration, genes and its variations. Biodiversity and ecology will also be included by the end of the course.I would say Prof Eugene Wong's teaching is excellent and Prof Raymond Wong's teaching is alright.The course is divided into mainly 2 parts. First part is taught by Professor WONG. It involves general biology knowledge as well as chemistry knowledge. The difficulty is relatively easy. For the second part, it is taught by Dr HUNG. It involve some advance biology knowledge that is based on the first part.Both professors have a dull voice that drives people asleep. The teaching method is the classic "PowerPoint and Talk". Each lecture is video-taped, therefore, it is not really necessary for people to attend lecture (only if you wish to).I am a mainland who studied biology in high school. This is the most important reason that I have the courage to enroll this course. Honestly speaking, things I learned in high school cover 90% of LIFS1901, and the rest 10% knowledge is complementary and useful and easy to digest if you study carefully. Generally, this course will truly introduce you to biology from micro to macro. I think it can arouse one's interest in nature to some extent. Well, of course, it depends on the instructor.I have to say that these two instructors are like the opposite. The former (before midterm) just told the content of ppt, even faster than you could read. The atmosphere was always silent and weird, and the instructor sometimes laughed for something only she herself thought funny. The latter was quite good in comparison (I am not saying she is  
good, just in comparison).She extended the content more and printed the clicker questions in the ppt and even ended the class earlier than expected if everything in the ppt has been taught.The content covered was as advertised in the description of the course - useful to know and understand but not too complicated for undergrads that may not work on neurochemistry later.The instructor's teaching style is not at all boring. The lecture often includes some discussions with students and some video watching from time to time. He also elaborate and slow the pace down when students found it hard to catch up.The content of this course covers the following 6 topics, including Fundamentals of life, The perpetuation of life, Evolution, Diversity of Life, Ecology, and Human biology. The contents are relatively easy to understand but the amount is quite large. Good memorising ability could manage the course easily. It is also recommended for students who have no biology background but interested in biology.The teaching of Prof. Wu is a bit boring. The teaching of Prof. Leung and Prof. Miller are far more interesting and engaging. In general all three professors went through all contents clearly with detail explanation. Especially for Prof. Leung, she likes to share with students a lot of personal experience in order to strengthen their understanding on the related topics, and to taught us more about environmental protection. The course also provides lecture video in case you missed any of the lectures.Quite a lot of topics covering a bit of DSE scope. I did not study Bio before so I just borrowed books from ny high school friends. It did help a little.The whole course is divided into 3 parts taught by 3 professors. The first one is Prof Wu who just deserves a bad grade of E. So boring in lesson. He just keeps talking according to notes without initiating any group discussion or asking questions. The second one is a female professor but i already forgot her name sor;) She is quite friendly and tries to create a more interesting learning vibe. She can have a B. As for the last one is Prof Miler. Actually I have skipped all his lessons and I just watched one lecture video. He is quite nice but has too many useless lecture notes.Atoms, molecules, and life’s chemistry

The contents are very interesting if and only if you love to study biology. (i.e. you need to be passionate about studying biology in order to follow the contents and materials taught in class.)I think each of them has different style of teaching. Professor Wu most of the time read from the PPTs, but he explained concepts very well, both in class and after class.

Dr. Leung was a kind of exam-oriented person. She usually said, "It doesn't matter as it won't appear in exams". She did revision with us before the exams but that's the trick. Actually, I found that most of the stuff she said is important did not appear on exams. She sometimes asked some minor questions from her notes.

Professor Miller is a very cheerful man and he explained every concept very well. He repeated one concept for more than ten times in one lecture and tried to impress us. The questions asked by him in the exam are quite straightforward and those questions are concepts that he emphasized in class.Basic biology is taught in the lesson and the notes are clear enough. The first part of the course included quite a lot of chemistry which is a bit not related to biology. However, for the second part of the course, it is more likely about geography because of the classification of life and ecology. The third part is about human and we have studied about heart, nerve systems, etc.The professors read through the PowerPoint. The lesson is quite boring but attendence is not taken.For No Biology Background students Only
This course is divided into three parts:
Prof Wu : Life Chemistry, Cell Cycle, DNA
Prof. Melody:  Evolution, Ecology,
Prof Miller:  Circulation system, Nervous System, Muscles, (Nobel Prize winner..)Prof Wu : teach according to the powerpoint slides, sometimes there may be some important stuff in his saying (for the exam)

Prof Melody: Interesting lessons, tips class before exam, well-organized ppt

Prof Miller: He is extremely passionate in his teaching, just I don't get the parts while he is so enthusiastic to say thing new to us...(Poor powerpoint for black background, and 200 pages something ppt)Covers basic topics of biology like cells, ecosystem, classification of life like animals, plants, virus, etc. The last topic discussed were about the human body.Lecture videos provided, lecture notes uploaded in advance.
The teaching differs from each lecturer but the lecture notes pretty much covers the content.
One lecturer (the last one) prefers student to come to class so he likes to show slides that were not included in the lecture notes in canvas.Course goal: This course aims to introduce to students diversity of life forms; origin of life;
chemical basis of life; cell structure and function; genetics and molecular biology; structure
and life processes in animal and plants; evolution; ecology and environment.
Intended learning outcomes:
1. Explain fundamental principles and inter-relationship among biochemicals, cells, and
life.
2. Describe the process of evolution and its implication in biodiversity.
3. Describe the structure and life processes in human.
4. Explain the inter-relationship between organisms and the environment.
5. Apply the biological knowledge in explaining current issues relating to human life.Teaching is fine, most of the students skipped class because the lecture video is uploaded in canvas.
Teacheer don't care, so your mark wont be affected even though you didn't come to any of the lectures.The content in quite diverse and there are many paragraphs in each set of note. But do not worry about it as prof. ZHU would tell you what to remember before each exam. Therefore, it is very important to go to the review session.As Prof. ZHU has a lot of knowledge in terms of research and other area too. He would sometimes diverge out to talk about different topics which are not related to the notes at all but most of them would not be examined if he did not mention it in the review session. The professor is super nice, so you could ask loads of questions after class.This is one of the most difficult LIFS course I've ever taken so far. There were a lot of content to understand and many were quite new to me. Be prepared to spend most of your revision time on this since this is a 4 credit course and has a heavy weighting on your GPA.I found King Chow and Danny's part quite intriguing and found them enjoyable. They were able to engage and address any questions by the students but I wish they went a bit slower. There were tons of info to take in in a short period of time.
For Prof Xue and Prof Hung, they were typical professor who goes through PPT without much engagement with students. However, they are very passionate to help with any problems regarding to the course.Contents by Eugene, King Chow and Danny are quite interesting. But require knowledge from molecular biology and biostatistics that is not taught so detailed in this course.Eugene teaches everything so detail that you may easily get bored.
King Chow is the best prof among four, very interesting teaching. Very few words on powerpoint so you may better attend his lecture.
Danny's teaching is quite good.
Hannah xue is the worst prof as she speak softly and just read out everything on powerpoint.Eugene: Solve 100 textbook and tutorial questions, then you will ace the mid-term exam.

King: Don't focus on the slide information.

Danny: Study his slides and concentrate on everything he says. They directly come up in the finals.

Hannah: Half of the questions on the finals paper are not explained at all in her slides.Eugene's teaching style might be monotonous. However, when you listen to him carefully, you will find yourself understanding the material. Very fond of him.

King is passionate in his teaching. Compared to the amount he talks however, there are not many concepts that you can understand or remember.

I very much like Danny's teaching style. One of the best. He is the master of explanation. His tone and pronunciation are perfect. He makes sure students understand by explaining again and inviting questions.

Hannah. First time I fell asleep.for the content, each professor is teaching different content.
HUNG, Siu Chun:
-basic Mendelian genetics
-gene mapping
-log of odd analysis
-IBD
Chow King Lau
-molecular genetics
-biostatistic
Xue Hong
-bioinformatics
-population genetics
Leung Danny Chi Yeu
-forward genetics
-reverse genetics
-recombinant DNA technology
overall the contents are interesting and useful in biology analysis.For the 4 professor, Danny and King Chow is teaching the best, both of them their tone are clear, but they talk really fast, so students will easily miss the important concept. If you cannot follow, I strongly advise you to ask them after class.

For Hung, Siu Chun. the powerpoint a dull, explanation is not doing well due to his tone, but he will give you a detailed walk through of every step of the analysis.

Finally for Xue Hong. She is probably the worse professor I have ever met, there is no doubt that her power point is detailed. However, the power point is in fact power paragraph, Moreover, she skip all the pictures in the powerpoint and direct read aloud the powerpoint's content.Eugene part: He changed to more mathematical things: cross linkage, probability calculation (chai square stuff), genetic mapping etc.

King Chow: gene regulation, non threshold trait

Hannah: more related to mapping and technology part (her major field is bioinformatics)

Danny: more on experiemtn; genetic screening, knock down etc.Eugene: he's a super nice, super sweet guy, but so sadly, bad at teaching. Do the questions in the book, read the book and go ask prof. if you encounter something unclear or think it is contradictory. Sometimes, he says something wrong.

King Chow: Who chose him as the best lecturer? He is very enthusiastic but no idea why it is so sleeping. Good luck with his part..

Hannah: didnt attend the class.

Danny: nice teaching; fluent in EnglishAbout everything you need to learn about genetics, from the basic mendelian rules (now with 1000% more crossing over) to recombinant DNA tech to population genetics and evolution.

The first half, taught by Eugene, is mostly mechanical and largely overlaps with what used to be covered in HKALE except for certain more advanced tests/techniques. (40% of grade)
The second half is jointly taught by King Chow, CY Leung (:P) and Xue Hong (each 20%)Eugene Hung
I kind of feel sorry for him, being handed one of the most boring/mechanical parts of the course. He teaches with heart and  "nice" is an understatement for him; however, he is not helped by his slow and accented speech.

Anyway, this is the part where you should grab as much points as possible to secure a good grade as everyone does well here.

King Chow
Attending a lecture by Prof Chow is like watching an episode of Sherlock; it is an exhilarating ride that's truly thrilling and enthralling - but that is if you could understand the convoluted plot. For others who, unfortunately, could not decipher his lectures, it is the most confusing thing in the world.

Unfortunately, the "others" include the majority of the class: the average score for his section is 6.20/20, which KC already considers "quite high" (last year it's 3.78/20)

Danny Leung
Quite the eloquent speaker. Native accent, appropriate speed and clear delivery in a somewhat comfortable traditional style of teaching. Uses lively examples to demonstrate his concepts.

His lectures were kind of straight forward and not too difficult, so most students wouldn't encounter problems here.

Xue Hong
Absolute waste of time. Horrendous accent and sluggish teaching pace, not to mention the fact that she reads directly from her powerpoint slides. I finished all her lectures and tutorials (I skipped them) in maybe 3 or 4 hours.Basically about Genetics, with lots of things to reciteDr. Leung,Good teaching and explaining concepts well.
Dr. Hung is trying his best to deliver the content, and provided a lot of examples.
Dr. Chow is not speaking with the power point slides so its a bit difficult for students to follow
Dr. Xue is basically reading the power point slides, without much interaction with the studentsNo CommentEach prof has a different teaching style, Prof Hung gives traditional instructive lectures and insightful discussion topics on Canvas; Prof Chow and Prof Leung's lectures make you think more and are therefore more interesting; Prof Xue's lectures are read from the book and basically useless.See attachment :DThis course is taught by 4 professors this year
Eugene taught the first month or so, then King Chow until midterm, and then Danny and Hannah after midterm.

Eugene
He's a pretty clear in teaching the concepts, and really makes sure you understand (if he doesn't get good responses he'll literally put together another powerpoint to reexplain the problem the next lecture)
He repeats the key concepts 3 times though, so it's okay to zone out a bit in class
What I don't like is he doesn't do enough practice questions with us in class, so I don't know how to do like half of the tutorial questions
If he taught faster and did a bit more practice with us that would be great.

King Chow
KC doesn't really teach according to his powerpoint
His classes are more discussion sessions on key concepts and then 5 minutes later he'll be like, "okay so we covered this, this, and this" -skips a bunch of slides-
It's okay though, because his exam isn't according to his powerpoint anyway. Just treat his powerpoint as some key concepts (which he will stress over and over again in class) + other interesting information you may want to know (which he will skip in class)
His exam questions are more experimental design and big picture stuff, and the tutorial questions should give you a good idea what they will be like.
Oh, and don't sit in the front if you're scared of being asked questions; he points to people sometimes.
But if you're into scientific discussions, KC's classes will be very interesting and fun.

Danny
A new professor in LIFS (and a very cute one indeed)
I have a feeling he's going the KC route, but he's less intimidating I guess?
He teaches clearly but very quickly, perhaps even faster than KC (because he's covering things on the powerpoint, unlike KC's discussion style)
His exam is very much based on the powerpoint, but there is one long question that was like an experimental design problem (like what KC would give, really)
So if you have no problems with KC's style you'll probably enjoy Danny just as much (or even a bit more)
Oh, and study the tutorial questions (at least memorize the answers). Some of the MCs may appear in the final ;)

Hannah
She basically reads off her very word-full powerpoint, and you may feel slightly... drowsy during class. Be sure to read the textbook chapters she posts too though, because they will appear in the exam.
I'm not a fan of her posting tutorial questions like 3 hours before the tutorial, because neither we nor the tutor have enough time to look at them, so we're all just thinking about the questions for the first time in class. As a result, our tutor's teaching quality greatly dropped during those two classes.
She taught 2 chapters this year, Chapter 19 and 23 (see attached course outline for details)
The exam questions for chapter 23 were okay, if you understand the powerpoint and the textbook you should be able to get them right (they're pretty much just calculations and basic concepts on population genetics)
However, the questions on chapter 19 (genomics) were... I have no idea where they came from. They were very paper/research-based, asking you to make inferences from some random conclusion. I wasn't even sure I was in the right exam room when I did them.
Just give it up to luck. Chances are, others will do just as poorly.No Comment1. King Chow: only taught for the mid-term part. As the most famous professor in Life science, you probably have heard about him. He is a good teacher, only if you are smart enough to follow his mind. He speaks at normal speed, but you will feel headache after every class. You can skip his lecture, but you need to watch lecture videos, make sure you understand everything he says. His midterm, you don't even need to practice the exercise from tutorials or from the book, because basically his exam is WAY harder than that.
2. Eugene: nice, willing to explain everything. But probably too nice and will not stop until he explained everything. His part is easier in understanding wise, but still quite complicated, which you need to grasp by doing all the exercises that he told you to do, then you definitely do well in his exams as he will put similar questions in it..
3. Xue Hong: basically don't go to her class, unless your hobby is wasting your life. She won't explain anything, and her notes are literally just copied from the text book directly. So she sucks, period. And her part was all MCs, super amazingly hard(even though everyone in previous years said they were easy)Basic molecular biology stuff including transcriptional and translational regulation at detailed level.Do not need to listen just memorize all then you get good grade.Normal LIFS course grading. Midterm have all question types including True or False, fill in the blanks, short and long question, drawing. Midterm is mainly Prof Liang's part which is quite easy while Final is mainly from Prof Wu. Final examination has some design like questions like, asking students which laboratory techniques can be used to prove and stain.Midterm & Final. Personally, I think Prof Wu's ppt is not quite organized, so students may need to spend more time to interpret it.

One assignment from Prof Liang, but it is quite easy.The course covers a wide range of topics but overall it can be simplified to prokaryotic cell replication and eukaryotic cell replication.

Within cell replication, they will cover replication DNA transcription, DNA translation, regulation of these mechanisms and many more.Professor Liang is quite good in teaching. I do wish his slides were organized a little better so that it makes it much simpler to comprehend. Sometimes, there was too much information on one slide. The midterm covers only his part and it was quite difficult to be honest. It had true or false, fill in the blanks, a few short answers and multiple choices. The questions, especially the fill in the blanks, can be quite ambiguous so perhaps that's why the midterm felt difficult.

Professor Wu is a great professor. He really knows the material very well. However, he isn't the best explainer. Sometimes when he explains a concept, he may go off topic or over-explain to a point where you might be more confused then you originally were. That's why you really should watch the lecture video in-depth and religiously if you want to do well.  If you have questions as he is giving the lecture, I would recommend you to wait until the lecture is over and ask him personally. He explains much better there.You can enjoy some great experience in dissecting marine creatures, taking ecological survey. It would be interesting if you like the marine creatures and are curious about marine creatures.Each TA is responsible for one lab so some of the TA are not understand the details. If you have question, try to ask Cindy or Simon. They are really nice.Cover different aspects of marine biology, from testing the % of salt in seawater to dissect different marine organisms (sea urchin, squid, cuttlefish, fish, worm; it may be changed)

There are two field trips, one is about the mudflat and one is about rocky shore.Don't expect the tutorial before the lab can teach you anything, the TA (PhD students) are responsible for this part, normally they are very busy so they won't have time to prepare it, just read the lab manual before the labMultivariable Calculus.
Not too much content and it is very simple and easy.Professor QIAN taught the class very well. However, he is quite strict in students who use electronic devices (including mobile phones and laptops) in classroom. He also likes to ask students to anser questions. So if you decide to go to the lecture, the only thing you can do is listening to him.Multivariable Calculus.

unclear concept=too much summary=diffcult
clear concept=not too much but need to revise=acceptableHo Hon Ming is very good.
but tutorial =useless
tutor is Kiki or Kitty(I forgot her name)
she is of much passion to teach students.
she always gives some extra Q&A session before exams
BUT, she speaks too soft in class.
If you really want to learn things, plz ask her after the lessons.
even though I sit in front of the most students. I still can't hear what she said.Just simple introduction to the multi cal. If you have good concepts ion basic cal, this course is just a piece of cake.Dr Ho gives full explanations to the question you raised.  So there will have no difficulties if you have problems.Dr. Ho will give a very good grade if you work hard, like reading his lecture notes thoroughly and complete all his review questions.Just simple webwork questions which are not once per week, like once for 2 weeks or even 3 weeks. So the workload is low comparatively speaking.Simple multivariable calculus including differentiation and integration with more than one unknown.
the calculus change from 2d to 3d but the method is quite similar. If u are familiar with the differentiation and integration and 3d graph, it will not be hard for u.Dr Ho is very nice.
He will answer all your questions after the lecture.
The teaching is not fast and he explain it clearly in the lecture.
There will be lecture videos for u to revise.
But for me it is better to watch the video with 1.5x speed.Personally, it feels much better than 1014 as the syllabus is a lot more concentrated on only several topics in calculus. Notes were given out every lecture and lecture videos were also uploaded.Although notes are given out every lecture, the professor likes to hand write the notes every lecture and explain the example questions step by step. I find the example questions on the notes quite useful as the professor used some of the exact questions in the midterm and final exam.On the basis of Math 1013 and 1014, more practical content in integral and vector. If you are good at physics, the later half part of the course could be more smoothly understood by imagining it in magnet.Dr. Ho is good at drawing. He has so many colorful pens. I saw a lot of people taking pictures in the lecture.

But sometimes it is a little bit not so straightforward. When you understand what he is talking about, you may find that it could be explained in one sentence rather than 10 minutes. I agree that the explanation provided by the professor is more accurate, but if you can find your own way of understanding the concept, it would be good for exams.Teaching more in-depth calculus,such as multiple integrals, and partial differentiation, vector fields, line integrals. They are quite useful for analysis of data which has multiple variables.Extremely strict lecturer, no cell phone is allowed, and pay fully attention to what he speaks, as he may ask you questions.
i recommend that never skip his lessons, so you will know what he is doing, and have a better understanding when studying his notes.The content is too much. There are far more content than an average student can handle. You are not only required to understand the content, but also to work out the mathematical problem savvily within merely one semester. That is a little bit too harsh.I would say, everything is too quick. Given that the content is already huge, he did not spend much time on details. Once you don't understand some content in the lectures, you are never going to understand the theorems derived from that particular topic and you will be lagged behind severely.multivariable calculus. the content of the course is a bit difficult but appropriate. content before midterm is high school stuff but after is totally different.Dr Hon Ming Ho is very good. He delivers the content clearly and throughly. good professor, class is video recordedGrade of the course is good.the course have about five webwork to complete. not too much workload. no attendance for both lecture and tutorial. lecture is video recorded so no need to attend lectures. midterm and final is not very difficult, but need to be familiar with lecture notes.very good teaching style, the course materials are very interesting, and I like the hand writing of the professors.

****Stroke's Theorem is not covered in the Exam.****Most of the teaching time of Dr. HO is following a step by step procedure to show you how to set up and solve the problem. Have some illustrations to let you better understand different theorem. Some questions appear in lecture notes and practice exercisecan be found in the examinations.Contents are too much, even though the example can express the theorem clearly, you need to spend time on really understanding them. The application part is so hard that if you are not so familiar with the meaning behind the formula, you won't able to do it.HHM teaches really good, but the grades are not. You can watch the lecture video to revise.Differentiation in several variables, with applications in approximation, maximum and minimum and geometry. Integration in several variables, vector analysis.Dr.Ho provides his colour printed notes for every lecture. He will use various methods to help remember the details of each lecture. He will also provide lecture videos for you to review. For the tutorial, it is optional because you can do the exercise on your own.it's essential for any engineering discipline.

For civil engineering, this course is very important for fluid mechanics, and therefore hydrosystems engineering. Fluid is a painful course, but having a good grasp of multivariable will definitely help a lot.

For computer science, it's not a required course but it's strongly recommended to take this one or Math2023, since multivariable is really fundamental for machine learning/vision graphics/etc.I really like Prof Leung's teaching. It's sad that I couldn't get a chance to take his class again in math3312.Polar coordinates,  Vectors, partial differentiation, Double integrals, Triple integrals, Conservative vector fields
Those topics are very useful and not very difficult.This professor only has handwriting note. If you print out the note, you cannot easily read the note. Also, the picture of the example put in the last paper of the note, it is not convenient for us to read.L1- The xyz-Coordinate system

Tutorials gave some good exercises and the TA KONG, Hoi Sang explain pretty well.This is a course in multi variable calculus. Topics include vectors and geometry of lines and surfaces, partial differentiation of functions of several variables and its applications in linear approximation, maximum and minimum, multiple integrals, line and surface integrals, and vector analysis.
The material after midterm is more difficult, especially those line and surface integrals so practice more on these topics.Dr Ho is very careful in his teaching. He always teaches us step by step and tries to provide the most professional and precise explanation . Although I was very sleepy during the morning lecture and learnt very roughly in the class, it was still not that hard to follow his pace.Partial derivatives

[Didn't have time to teach Stoke's theorem]Dr. Ho tends to read out and WRITE down EVERY SINGLE words on his lecture notes. His tone and pronunciation are easy to understand. (unlike the math concepts he is trying to deliver)

Things to do: 1. Take the notes 2. Go watch lecture videos if really don't understand the lecture notes. (Hand-written notes during lectures are much neater)The content is nice and interesting,
Starts with basic vectors, to multivar. diff. calculus (for midterm) and then multivar. integral calculus (for final).He teaches fine. I would say attending lectures are important since the examples he works out in class are very similar to the questions he puts on the exam. (some of them might be a lil harder).This course splits into two main topics: Vectors and Calculus.

For vectors, the course includes basic vectors calculation like addition, subtraction, dot product and cross product of vectors. It also teaches how to find planes and lines equations by vectors. And gradient vectors and directional derivatives is included too.

For calculus, partial derivatives, double and triple integrals, line integral, surface integrals, Green's Theorem and Divergence Theorem. Maybe includes Stroke's Theorem but the lecturer didn't have enough time to finish it so it didn't appear in final exam.

For me, the most difficult topics are using vectors to find distances between two lines/planes and surface integrals. But overall the calculus part is easier than the vector part.Dr. Ho really teaches with the heart. He always give colour lecture notes with lots of pictures and examples for students and speaks clearly step by step. Because he won't use powerpoint but handwritting instead, you have to mark down many contents in your notes. And no lecture notes are uploaded online so you need to attend his class to get the notes.1.Parametric and Polar Curves
2.Vectors and Vector-Valued Functions
3.Functions of Several Variables
4.Multiple Integration
5.Vector CalculusProfessor taught very well. He made things easier and delivered the concepts clearly. He did not allow students to use mobile phone during his lesson.Vectors; Partial Derivatives; Multiple Integration; Vector Calculus.
Not difficult but useful enough for engineering students.The teaching was really good and attractive. Though I only went to the lecture once, that might be the second best lecture I've ever had in UST (First belongs to Prof. Kursun). BTW, Prof. Qian doesn't like his students to use mobile phones in his classes, and I think his lecture would be more attractive than Clash of Royale. The lecture notes are all hand-written. Though can't use ctrl+F, it's still very useful and informative.Content is useful. Every concept is related constructively and concisely.Teaching was perfect. Flow of class is perfect, easy to understand. The Lecture was the best lecture that I have taken in UST.Grading system was not generous that much unfortunately. Even if I believe I did well and got higher than 1sd, final grade was B+. It is not easy to get A range grade in this course but, B range is not that difficult.Many practice questions on a book. Also, webwork would be given to you every week.The content is relatively easy to grasp, and it progressively gets harder to understand.Professor Ho is a really good teacher, as he can help visualize concepts through his drawings and lecture notes, making the teaching really clear. It's recommended to come to lectures, as his explanations really aid the lecture notes.There are several topics covered, including vector, multi-variable calculus, field, flux etc. It seems quite useful in the future studies especially if you are in Physics, Maths or Mech major. Most of the content is similar to this page: http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/CalcIII.aspx
It is recommended to self-study this web since the lecture notes are too difficult to read.Ho Hon Ming is famous for his color notes which can only be obtained on lesson. He will do the examples of the lecture notes in the lectures. The steps in the lecture notes are full of words so if you like reading, it is good for you. However, I am not that kind of person.Basic knowledge in multi-variable calculus.
1.First talk about vector and parametric equations.
2.Then partial differentiation and its applications on gradient vectors.
3.Also multiple integration:double integrals and triple integrals
4.The last part is vector calculus: line integrals and surface integrals and 3 big theorems
(BUT Stoke's theorem is not included in this semester)Professor: Ho Hon Ming has coloured notes. So attend every lecture to get the notes.
The notes have example questions and answers, but he would write down all the steps in the lessons.
Also, he once sent an email to encourage us not to give up in the final exam!

Tutor: My tutor is Einstein Kong. He explained the concepts very clearly and he has a website which includes all the tutorial notes with answers.Very interesting content. Fun to study. Main topics include Differential calculus, Polar and parametric curves, partial derivatives. multiple integration, vector fields.Lectures are quite interesting. The professor gives interesting questions to solve as well as is open to discussing previous semester paper questions.3d space view, vectors, directional derivatives, gradient, double and triple integral, line and surface integral, etc.The best professor imo, teaches very well and explain clearly. The  notes are in good quality as well. As long as you go to every lessons, you can easily understand every stuff in the course even without a strong basic of calculus.The content is a bit harder than what we have learned in MATH1014 and requires integration techniques and similar concepts in MATH1014. The contents after midterm are much harder than what I learned before the midterm.

The topics are:
1. Vectors, Dot products  Cross products, Line and curves in space
2. Vector-valued functions, Motion in space, Length of curves
3. Functions of several variables, level curves, limits and continuity of functions of several variables
4. Conversion between cylindrical, rectangular and spherical coordinate systems, partial derivatives, Chain rules.
5. Gradient vectors, Tangent planes  
Tangent planes on the aspect of approximation, Extreme values

After the mditerm:

6. Double integration on rectangular regions, double integration on general regions, polar coordinate system
7. Double integrals in polar coordinate, surface area, triple integrals in rectangular coordinate system.
8. Triple integrals in cylindrical coordinate system, line integrals, vector fields and line integrals in vector fields
9. Flux of a vector field, path independence, potential functions and conservative vector fields and Green’s theorem in the plane
10. Surface integrals, flux of a vector field across a surface
11. Divergence theoremProfessor Ho prepared notes very carefully and spent much time explaining difficult concepts with vivid models and examples.

The speed of teaching will be quicker after the midterm due to the course structure. It may be better if you review the lecture notes accompanied with sufficient exercises each week to refresh your knowledge.Topics:
1.Lines and Planes, Parametrization
2.Vector Calculus, Arc Length
3.Partial Derivatives, Directional Derivatives, Extreme Values
4.Double and Triple Integration
5.Line Integral, Green's Theorem
6.Surface Integral, Divergence TheoremTeaching flow is perfect, explaination is very clear, always use different colours of pens.  Not much to jog down as coloured lecture notes include everything.

My TA is Einstein Kong, again coloured notes.  His explaination is as clear as Dr.Ho, he is willing to answer questions from students.Vectors, Partial Differentiation, Double/Triple Integrals, Kine Integrals, Vector fields, Green's TheorumI like Professor Qian's teaching style a lot. He tried to make the atmosphere relax for students. He also like to answer questions from students a lot.10% webwork
30% midterm exam
60% final exam

Mean for both exams around 60%.

Mean should be C+/B-.A bit high since webwork questions are super challenging. You need to understand the concepts really well (especially for double/triple integration) to answer some questions. Of course you can always use other software to do the questions but it is not recommended.

Both midterm and final exam are much easier than webwork questions. You can complete the exams in a very short time. Just be careful with careless mistakes.EZ

but little boring in the first few lecturesteaching is shit sadly

after two weeks of consecutive disappointment, decided not to turn up to lectures at all

self taught

it was easier for me to find proper math text book and self teach with youtube and do examples on textbook.

although i only studied for few days before two exams, I still aced exam

ezBefore the midterm, the course covers the rigorous definition of limits (That is how to prove for example that the limit as x approaches a of x^2 = a^2 using well defined mathematical formulations and being rigorous while doing so). This part emphasized proofs and professor Hu Proved everything he wrote, and I mean everything. You won't be expected to repeat his proofs in the exam but you are expected to understand them since you can use a similar way to prove other questions he might ask. Also, he covers all the differentiation rules and again proofs the product rule, quotient rule, etc. After the midterm, he focused on on the applications such as optimization problems, sketching graphs, intermediate value theorem, mean value theorem, L'hospital rule, local and global minima and maxima, concavity, etc. Overall, the course has a really rewarding content and I definitely recommend taking it if 1) you don't care about the grade that much and 2) if you are going to major in maths. The course has improved my mathematical maturity so much and made me think of most stuff in terms of their proofs and definitions, definitely a well constructed calculus course and is almost the same difficulty (if not harder) than other calculus courses in other US universities such as MIT and Caltech, etc.Professor Hu, for me is one of the best mathematics professors that ever thaught me in my life. He has many famous sentences such as: "You don't know the definition, you get a big 0" and "Your intuition tells you that this limit is 0? well my intuition tells me that YOU get a 0" and finally "Analysis is a hard subject, every year at least 3 people commit suicide in MIT because of analysis:". Professor Hu teaching is extremely funny and laid down and you can sense he enjoys what he does, he focuses on two things: LOGIC and DEFINITION, if you lack one in your answer then you're getting a big 0. For example, the limit as x approaches infinity of (1/(x+4)) = 0 since the denominator grows to infinity and 1 divided by a very big number is 0. if you write this in the exam you get a 0. To get the mark, you can either 1) proof that the limit of 1/x+4 is indeed 0 by the DEFINITION or use logic and algebraic manipulation to write 1/x+4 as (1/x)/(1+4/x). since we know limit as x approaches infinity of 1/x = limit of 4/x  = 0 and by the continuity of the polynomials, the limit is 0/(1+0) = 0/1 = 0 therefore we conclude the limit is 0. See how many steps we needed to show the limit of such an easy limit is 0? you have to follow similar arguments in ALL your answers or else, a big 0.

A final word about the TA (Xilin Li), this is arguably one of the best TAs in the maths department, the guy is very nice, he explains things thoroughly and you can meet him after class and he would even explain FULL lessons to you after class if you need it, he is always at the maths support center most of the time and I honestly wouldn't have gotten my A- without this guy. Seriously a life saver.

Also, for the lecture notes, review the attachments below, study from these notes since they are much harder and rigorous than the Stewart calculus book. everyone studies from it.We can obviously tell by the Prof's teaching that his materials are carefully selected from the previous Prof. Yan's note.
The lecture notes are beautifully written and uploaded in time. Compared to the homework and exercises, they are relatively easy and fundamental.
The tutorial notes are the less serious and more interesting part of the course. XDHonestly, this course is absolutely the best in my first sem.
Mr. Fong is not only humorous but has been behaving quite professional, logical and reliable during the whole semester.MATH 1023 is a more in depth version of MATH 1013. Their content is similar but fundamentally different. Both courses teaches only limit and differentiation, but 1023's is a more rigorous version and you are required to give a lot of reasoning. It surely require a strong background of mathematics in order to follow the course.Personally, Prof. Yan is my favorite professor. He like derive the different theorem with a pen and paper. All the steps he had done was well explained and his every derivation was based on the immediate sense he have.
Besides, I can sense that Prof. Yan is a respectable person.Basic calculus things, kind of in-depth.Prof. YAN really has his own thoughts on those topics involved in this course and he can explain everything clearly and very logically. Although his teaching is almost totally the same as his notes (written by himself and explain everything in details), it is worthwhile to go to his classes!

Well, he stop for a break for 5 min after every 15 min... Interesting, right? At that time you can feel free to ask him any questions and digest what you've just learned. He is always patient in asking students' questions.Covering limits and differentiation. Crucial to any kind of further learning in mathematics. The course is very well structured, requiring no previous knowledge of Calculus; however, proficiency in some high school-level mathematical operations is highly conducive.Organized, well-reasoned, engaging, supplemented with loads of examples. (Far) better than average pronunciation.Very useful for math & phys student.
If you do like the course style you can still take 1014 in the next semester as 1024 will be taught by the same person as 1023.If you do not like the joke, the course is the like hell.
But if you do understand what the hell he is talking about, then this is the right course for you xD.Professor FONG is a very cute and nice instructor. He can explain things very clearly and is very patient in teaching. His homework can very nicely guide student to learn new things.Teaching is great. His spoken English is good. And he uses ipad to teach so that every one can see the process very clearly.Limitation and Derivative. The content are similar with 1013. The only difference is the content is deeper and the homework is harder.
It might be hard to caught up this course if your math is not well enough. But if you want to study pure math or learn more, this class will be helpful.
THINK TWICE before you enroll into this course. Not suitable for those who want to major in chemistry or biology.Very interesting instructor who tells many jokes in class. He prefers to use no ppt and only writes on his iPad during the class (but enough).
The TA is also helpful. (but he may be angry if no one respond to him in tutorial sections)same as yanming's note. home work contains 2 part.
1. text book excercise
2. extra excercise
first one is for peer checking
second is for TA checking
the second mostly decides the grade you will get for HM
but taht not means you needn't to do part 1really wonderful. everything seems easy to solve, and you can learn the method but not only the sollutionTeaching progress was not fast which covers the main part of differential. The course went deep into the concept of fundamental calculus, forming a solid foundation for students to carry out higher level mathematical learning. During the course the related calculus knowledge was taught with some typical example which was easy to follow and some attractive and interesting expand knowledge such as Legendre polynomials  was also taught in class, making the course more "rich and colorful"The professor FONG, Tsz Ho is very interesting and humorous who always articulate points of knowledge clearly by combing some university-life-relevant jokes with mathematical concepts. The professor is also very kind and patient that you can feel free to ask any of the question relavant to the course. His teaching method is also commendable which focus more on the connection between knowledge of different chapters.
Since the professor was once a student in HKUST, he will know more about the problems that students might come across and give more appropriate advice on students' study.Well, I am very glad to have chosen this course. Because I think I can really learn something. Like Prof. Fong suggested, studying math 1013 is kind of waste, if you have studied calculus before.Prof. Fong's class is quite interesting, and he really is struggling to teach you better. But TA aren't always that helpful. Their problems are sometimes weird, and things you learned in class aren't helpful when solving them.The content is Calculus, which emphasized on the rigorous of mathematical deductions. For local students I personally thinks it takes time to adjust, as we are get used to simple computational mathematics. The content is similar to analysis. Some topics include:
rigorous definition of limits (which is kind of fun actually), differentiation, linear approximation etc. I learnt not a lot of new things, but certainly deepened my understanding towards calculus.In general I think the teaching by Prof. Fong is quite good. You are welcomed to ask questions during the break in the lessons (I think). I did not attend much lessons though (less than 5 I think), but I encourage you to attend lessons.

Another good thing is that lecture videos and handwritten (on his pad) notes are provided which are vital for revision.The course covers Limit (Sequence Limit, Rigorous Definition, Criterion for Convergence, Infinity, Function Limit, Continuity) and Differentiation (Linear Approximation and its Application, Property of Derivative, Mean Value Theorem, High Order Approximation and its Application). Lecture notes very nice and complete.Clear presentation. Good sense of humor. Discussed a lot of useful examples in lectures. Focus on mathematical knowledge rather than just exams.The course covers the first two chapters of Prof. Min Yan's Calculus lecture notes(which can be easily found online). I am not a great fan of this notes as the examples don't contain the questions, just the solution so you have to guess what the problem was. The first part of the course is on limits and the rigorous definition, and the second part is on differentiation, and its applications. Everything is built from scratch, as there is no prerequisite, other than mathematical maturity. This course is aimed at students with interests in math or physics as majors.Proffesor is really good, he always came prepared with slides which will be left in canvas for future reference. Although the lectures can help giving an insight all the material can be lerned from reading the lecture notes only. Plus lectures are recorded so if you are really good you can take the privilege of skiping them.

Tutorials have some really interesting questions to practice problem solving skills, but attendance is not required. In fact they even said that if you can solve them by yourself there is really no reason for you to attend tutorial.A first-year math course with some approaches in analysis (eg rigorous definition of sequence/function limit), which is quite useful if you are going to major in math.With well-written lecture slides and his interesting way of teaching, it is not hard for most students to catch up his teaching.Before midterm:(Rigorous) definition of limit of sequence, sandwich theorem, monotone convergence theorem, Cauchy Sequence, (rigorous) definition of function limits

After midterm: Continuity, IVT; Differentiation, linear approximation, implicit differentiation, MVT, L'Hopital's Rule, taylor series, higher derivative test, concavity and Jensen's Inequality.

    (Almost) Everything is derived from scratch so no prior knowledge is needed (in the sense that it won't help), but mathematical maturity is a must, and you will definitely develop that from homeworks and tutorials.

    This course really encourages thinking the logic and proof behind everything instead of doing boring computations (we do have some though).  We started by assuming only the most basic rules (like arithmetic rule of limits), and then use the rigorous definition to build up everything. It makes you think twice on any seemingly easy question, and think of what you actually did, instead of skipping steps all over like what I did in DSE.

    I had a friend asking me about a limit problem and I explained to him the arithmetic rule, and the composition rule, and he don't understand. He said: What are all those rules? I didn't use those rules and I got the answer anyways. I said: You said you didn't use it because you don't know you are using it. That's why you get things wrong. You just assumes things and blindly use it (like the L'Hopital's Rule). Taking MATH 1023 really made me more careful when doing problems.

    (Some contents actually overlap with MATH 2033 so if you have made your way to the end of 1023, you should have an easier time in that. Professor said that some of our content is actually harder.)His teaching is good. He often make jokes in lectures which helped (at least) me focus. We often have breaks in between so we can digest what he just said and we can ask questions as well.

    One time he devoted the whole lecture talking about the application of IVT, albeit not quite related to the course, is definitely interesting if you like maths.

    Keep in mind that the homework is much more difficult than the lectures, and professor said that the learning really only begins in the homework.

    The tutorials are ok. Sometimes the TA prepared some questions that he have no idea how to solve, or need to use clueless complicated stuff to solve. And he sometimes can't finish the notes. There are good questions in the tutorial though.Prof Yan spent 2 months to talk about limit, from the rough meaning of limit, different tricks to solve limit, to the rigorous defination of limit(ε-δ definition). All of them were taguht by rigorous prove and logic.
Afterwards, prof Yan only spent 1 month to teach differentiation, including rigorous defination of differentiation(linear approximation), mean value theorem, l'Hôpital's rule, Taylor expansion.
The main difference between 1023 and 1013 is that 1023 require you to understand all the rigorous prove but 1013 just give you the solution.
I think the content is too much and we don't have enough time to digest all of them before exam.Both lecture and tutorial are useful, don't skip it.
Both Prof Yan and Li Xilin can explain the concept clearly by only a few words, you can follow him easily, given that you can catchup the last lesson and well prepered.
LI Xilin can speak English without accent though he came from Minland. Moveover, his tutorial worksheets are great tool for your practise.Some basic theorems and properties of limit. (i.e.  limit of sequence, properties of limit, monotone sequence, Cauchy criterion, infinity, limit of function, continuous function, intermediate value theorem, invertible continuous function)
Some basic theorems and properties of differentiation. (i.e.linear approximation, derivative, property of derivative, monotone function, extrema, means value theorem, high order approximation, high order derivative, Taylor expansion.)Min Yan teaches quite well. His english pronunciation is clear. He tries to derive everything step by step by using pens and a pice of paper. Obviously, he did prepare before the lessons. But sometimes it is sleep inducing. We had lots of breaks during the lessons which according to min yan is for you to digest what he had taught and ask him questions. But I think the breaks are not necessary. Min Yan is also willing to answer any questions you raised.Very hard but reasoning, it will be closer to the mainland version rather than 1013, it contains lots of proving.however the teaching is a little bit fastOK if you really put all of your effort in, but the B range is very wide.
And the mean is high enough.Every week have problem sets from the text book and it really takes time and sometime there is no answer and we have to search for answers through some website that Professor will tell you during the lecture.Good to understand! Only if you take enough time will you find you get better insight into calculus!The teacher stresses much importance on the demonstration because he believes idea is more important than calculating!Since the A range is wider so it might seem easier to get a A. But the density of mainland students is also large. Therefore, getting a A is actually challenging!Yanmin stressed that we should finish all the exercise(some of which are repetitive) in the notes and you should hand in solutions to some particular problems he chose.Less than Math 1013, but more adequate.
Very interesting, professor is funny and often talk about other math knowledge to us.
Tutorial is useful and more difficult than lecture.HU did not use ppt in class. He like writing something on the white board and do not have notes. So we need take note by ourselves.this course contains limit of  function as well as sequence, Rolle's law, mean value theory, L'Hospital's role, property of function, not as abundant as i expected.quite clear, and the professor himself is very nice. you are sure to understand the question that he has taught. but sometimes he likes to speak Chinese during class.This course is basically equal to 1013, but with many more vigorous delta-epsilon prove of differentation. This will be somehow challenging, but once you practice well you will be fine.Prof HU is passionate on the vigorous proof part, but somehow lose interest of the regular 1013 differentation part......

TA in the course is very nice and helpful, he explain the concept clear, basically he will answer every question you asked...A course in differential calculus.

First half of the course: limits of sequences; functional limits (ε-δ definition), difficult but very intereseting
It would be a good idea to pick and read an analysis book

Second half: applications like the L'hopital rules, optimisation, curve sketching. There was nothing new and hard so many got full marks in the final exam.

But Taylor series and Leibniz rule were left out this year.
But the final exam tested Newton's method which is not in his syllabusYou will probably like him If you are talented enough. Otherwise no.This course covers limits and differentiation.
Before mid-term: proving limits using rigorous definitions
After mid-term: Applications of differentiation and L'hospitals Rule

Prof. Hu puts more emphasis on understanding definitions and less on lmastering algebraic techniques He didn't cover Leibniz's rule and Taylor polynomial, also didn't ask questions that requires (maybe unnatural) construction of functions to prove things.

I think 1023 is tough but manageable. Anyone with reasonable math sense could handle this class. I'd recommend this course to students who like to challenge themselves and share a love for math. Even if you only get a 5 in DSE math/ M2, I guarantee that you can still perform well in this course if you work hard.Very nice! Clearly he teaches with heart and brain. I don't know how to describe how well he taught. But I can assure you that his teaching could elevate your understanding in calculus to a whole new level.

What he focused on is DEFINITIONS! He said it many times in the lesson, 'MATHEMATICS IS ABOUT DEFINITIONS!!!!!' So instead of testing a hell ton of algebraic techniques he rather tested on how well you reason your steps. He once said it class while pointing his finger to a student, 'Your intuition tells the limit is 0, you get a 0!' I got a mark deduction because of skipping a tiny step when proving limits -.-!

But his approach of marking really forced students to beware of the importance of definitions, which makes 1023 much more rewarding (in terms of content only) than 1013. 1023 helps students adapting uni math. Students will eventually realize how dangerous it will be to do math without understanding definitions.A much more rigorous and a difficult course compared to math1013. The topics are actually same with math1013 but there are many proofs for you to learn thoughout the course. However, you will still get stuck with your weekly hw even you understand the proofs of the textbook. In my opinion, don't take this course if your DSE math core or m2 got lower than 5*. If you wish to take it, you will have to spend twice more time in this course than usual courses. And if you think you are really good at math in high school, you will probably change your mind after taking this course. Actually, I think this course is even more difficult than some math courses start with 2, so please think in-depth before you take this course. Its still worth to try if you really want to test yourself.Professor has a solid foundation at calculus but his teaching is not good. It takes some time to understand his English.We use the lecture notes written by Prof. Yan

13         higher derivative test, convexity and concavity

Overall the content is well organized, from one's intuition to rigorous definition, which can provide you with solid calculus background.

One flaw is that there are quite a few mistakes in the notes which may affect your understanding of the concept. If you have any question concerning the notes, just ask the professor.Frederick indeed devoted himself into teaching. He prepared each lectures very well and provided us with enough exercises.

Apart from that, he is also a fun and interesting person.

And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask,he is very nice and willing to answer your questions, even some really stupid ones.

Overall his English accent is quite good. May make some mistakes occasionally(i.e, found), but it doesn't cause any difficulties to the listener.

From my perspective, one tiny problem is that, his teaching is somewhat slow and what was taught in the lecture is somewhat easy(unlike the homework problem and the exams which are somewhat hard). And sometimes may be a little bit unclear.(Overall is fine.)

All in all, a good instructor indeed.Stress on the proof and logic flow of theory regarding limit of sequence and function, and calculus, including stuff such as rigorous definition of limit, convergence, Cauchy sequence, continuity, derivative, linear approximation, mean value theorem, central limit theorem, etc. the basic theory is taught during lecture and some application and prove of theory extended from the basic ones may be taught on tutor or as our homework.The teaching is not bad but i still found it hard to apply what they taught into application of the homework and test.The contents are quite challenging. Yet, some MO (Mathematical Olympiad) stuff is required, like AMGM inequality.
Topics:
inequalities
functions and their graphs
limit and continuity,
extreme value theorem
intermediate value theorem
derivatives and differentiation rules,
mean value theorem,
l'Hôpital's rule,
Taylor expansion, and applications of derivatives.The most humorous and elegant instructor ever.
Yet, the tutor is just bullshxt. I don't really know what he was doing because his presentation skills was extremely poor. I would like to spend more time on those tutorial problems with my friends or the tutor in maths support center rather than attending the tutorial classes held by that guy. (Chan Yan Long)VERY INTERESTING. The prof is quite funny and talk a lot about what he thinks mathematics is. quite a lot to learn from this course as well as the teacher.
the exams are fine. personally i find the tutorial notes are more difficult than the exam questions.
the tutorial teacher is quite good as well, he explains things patiently and explicitly.
only up to differentiation is covered in this course without any integration.interesting and inspiring1.1 Limit of Sequence
1.2 Rigorous Definition of Sequence Limit
1.3 Criterion for convergence
1.4 Infinity
1.5 Limit of Function
1.6 Rigorous Definition of Function Limit

2.3 Application of Linear Approximation
2.4 Mean Value Theorem
2.5 High Order Approxiamtion
2.6 Application of High Order ApproximationQuite clear.Rigorous proof and definitions of differentiation and some integration.
Really advise you to have at least 5* in M2 and even 5** in Maths to have this course.
The first week is only the introdctory of the course and if you still dont know what he say, then go to choose 1013. Because the latter one will be more difficult.I was taught by Wu Jishan and he was bad teacher in my opinion.
I saw they changed the teacher in 2014 fall and the teacher now taught 1023 I think is much more better.
Wu Jishan will answer your questions but he will answer in a way that he was not patient and underlooked you. And he did not teach in details so I nearly skipped all the classes.1. Limit of Sequences, Squeeze Theorem
2. Rigorous Definition of Sequential Limits
3. Monotone Sequences, Cauchy Sequences
4. Infinity, Limit of Functions

Copying from Professor Frederick: "Overall, 1023 demands much more on logical and critical thinking, and mature mathematical skills."

For example, to rigorously prove that \lim{x \to a, a^x} = 1, where a > 0 and hence a^x is continuous at 0. (See the attachments.)Professor Frederick is a well explainer. He is also efficient and organized that he like to post all the solutions immediately after the deadlines or the exams.

In terms of the teaching materials, Professor Frederick uses electronic hand-written slides (see the attachments) based on a 347-page lecture note written by Prof. Min YAN which even him does not read it. Also, there are lecture videos available in Canvas, which delay very often.The notes are not very hard,  so the content is not very challenging. But some of the content is lost, compared with that in mainland such as the upper and lower limit, or Stolz theorem, which is very regettable.His teaching skills are just so so, but I heard that it will be better when he teaches 4023 or others.Content is pretty easy and linear algebra is quite a useful subject. The lecture slides are also quite good as they go over everything needed and explain reasonably well, just the teaching is poor, I think especially for international students. The TA, Serena, speaks english natively, but she doesn't seem to take being TA very seriously and doesn't explain much in the tutorials, just repeats the answers (which are given out beforehand). It seems like she just, generally speaking, isn't good at math.The prof is nice, but a pretty bad teacher. He does not explain things conceptually, just teaches theorems and corollaries. Totally unintuitive and useless. Here is a really good series though on Youtube -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw&index=8&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_abI think the content is very good. This is math, what you expect to learn should be how to solve the problems. And this is not an elective, you take it because you have to, so you can really learn something.The instructor is very enthusiastic, speaks very loudly and makes jokes about himself. He gives examples and explains things clearly. You can always follow his pace.The material covers most of the information you have to know about linear algebra. Generally speaking, the content is quite simple compared to math 1014.Wong is the Best math instructor I have ever met in HKUST. Not only did he teach logically, but he was also willing to answer any questions students may have after class. His passionate in teaching this course really inspired me that I dare not skip any one of the lesson.The content is really interesting and has a variety of interlinked concepts. 7 main sections:
1. Intro to Matrices
2. Linear Dependence
3. Determinants
4. Vector Spaces
5. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
6. Orthogonality
7. Symmetric MatricesThis section may vary from person to person depending on how he/she interprets Lee's lectures. They are definitely helpful and worth attending. Some say it becomes boring but well, again really depends.Covers much of the required knowledge about matrices and their related spaces. Contents include:

- Gauss-Jordan Elimination
- Linear Dependence
- Vector Spaces
- Eigenvectors/Eigenvalues
- Orthonogality
- Inner Product Space

If you have done IB HL Maths or A-levels Further Maths, and scored decent for them, understanding the content wouldn't be very difficult.Pretty informative - he makes all teaching on the whiteboard, which gives you ample time to jot down notes and digest the concept. He provides notes with detailed explanations and examples for further study.- Book Recommended by the Professor:
Linear Algebra and Its Applications 5th Edition by David C. Lay, Steven R. Lay, and Judi J. McDonald. You can find the book online.

Chapter #1: Linear Equations in Linear Algebra: from 1.1 to 1.9
Chapter #2: Matrix Algebra: 2.1 - 2.3
Chapter #3: Determinants: 3.1 - 3.3
Chapter #4: Vector Spaces: 4.1 - 4.7
Chapter #5: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: 5.1 - 5.4
Chapter #6: Orthogonality and Least Squares: 6.1 - 6.5The lectures can get boring but the Professor is knowledgeable.If I must compare this maths course to other maths course in HKUST, this is fairly easy. Most concepts could be understood if you paid enough effort. I only did so through youtube videos and khan academy, still got a decent grade so just work hard :)I honestly can't stand listening to the lecturers English, I think she is from the mainland? After the first few lectures, most of us skipped class... So I guess the teaching is poorly done. However, the lecture notes are clear and even though the pronunciation is not clear, I could see that she put much effort into teaching so it really depends on whether you can stand her strong accent. If you really needed help you could always find help from MSC anyways, lectures is just a plus :)This course includes matrix and vector. About one-third of the lectures cover the DSE curriculum. The remaining content is a bit tough to learn.The professor will explain her lecture notes a bit and not just read aloud it. However, you can also learn by yourself as the notes is quite clear and detail.The mid-term is extremely easy but final is quite touch. I spend similar effort on both exam and I got 90% at mid-term but 50% at final. Finally I got a B-.There are totally 10 webwork through the semester. However the questions are quite tough so you must have to study the lecture notes for a while before you do the webwork.The course content is not as difficult as other math courses. Even if you do not have background on matrix, it is not difficult to catch up in class. It is strongly recommended to utilize the textbook referenced during the lecture and not rely purely on lecture slides.The lectures alone will be insufficient for a good grasp on the content. Tutorials were very efficient and effective in clarifying doubts during lectures. While the lecturer did manage to cover all the content and provide sufficient examples, there was not enough time to clear all the doubts in the course. The tutor was able to help out a lot during the tutorials.Similar to math2011, it’s an essential course for any engineering discipline.

For civil engineering, this course is involved in statics, and 2170, and possibly 3610.

For computer science, linear algebra is important for almost any subdiscipline, especially AI, vision graphics, and theoretical computer science.

Therefore it’s strongly recommended to put enough effort to study this course.Wong Ka Yue’s teaching is good and I liked it a lot.Concepts are easy to learn if you read the textbook.

I feel interested in matrix algebra, so I think the content is acceptable.

The teaching method of HHM are pretty nice and famous, I do not think I need to say too much about this.Referring to chapters in the textbook

Chapter 1: Linear Equations in Linear Algebra
Chapter 2: Matrix Algebra
Chapter 3: Determinants
Chapter 4: Vector Space
Chapter 5: Eigenvales & Eigenvectors
Chapter 6: Orthogonality & Least Squares

Since the teaching time is limited in the summer semester, some topics in orthogonality are excluded, such as The Orthonormal Decomposition Theorem, The Best Approximation Theorem and The Gram-Schmidt Process.Most of the teaching time of Dr. HO is following a step by step procedure to show you how to set up and solve the problem. Have some illustration to let you better understand different theorem. Some questions appear in the lecture notes can be found in the examinations.

However, the teaching of the TA was not good because he often made careless mistakes when doing the examples. Just take the tutorial notes and practice the exercises by yourself is OK.

Lecture Videos are also available in Canvas.Matrix caculation. If you want to go future study, you'd better take MATH2121.Quite good. I really like him. You don't need to print the notes and he would do so.I think grading is quite good. I got A. Just finished the homework and went to the class. At the beginning of each class, he would do a summary of previous class which is quite useful for preparing the exam.Just like other Math class, the workload was not quite high. There were around 10 homework each of which counted 1%.1. Linear equations in linear algebra
2. Matrix Algebra
3. Determinants
4. Vector spaces
5. Eigenvalues and eigenspaces
6. Orthogonality

The content before midterm comprises of the first 3 topics, which is quite easy to handle for students who have taken M2 in HKDSE. However, the content goes more difficult after the midterm, because some concepts about vector space are quite abstract, and those questions often require rigorous proves.
Since the lecture time is not enough, some topics in orthogonality are not included, such as orthogonal projection, properties about orthogonal matrix, best approximation theorem and the Gram-Schmidt Process.The teaching of Dr. Ho is awesome. He explain the concepts clearly and I can feel his passion for teaching. He will upload videos of every lecture on canvas and distribute colorful lecture notes on class. The only drawback is that he is not willing to upload his notes on canvas, so you have to attend every lesson in order to get his notes.

However, I think the TA is not quite good. He does not prepare the tutorials well, as he sometimes made careless mistakes in calculations, which wastes a lot of time. Also, he uploaded the answers of tutorial notes lately, sometimes ever a week late, which hinders my progress of revision.Content wasn't very interesting in my opinion, easily the hardest course I've taken so farWong is a good teacher with a relatively easier to understand accent compared to Jishan Hu
Furthermore, he goes over the previous class's material in every class making the transition from one topic to another smootherThe content is pretty straight forward and not very difficult if you're even slightly familiar with linear algebra.The teaching is very boring so I don't recommend going to every class.Grading is quite intense as other Math courses and you should look forward to at least 1.2 SD above in order to expect A-range. However, since a lot of students take class, the mean is not that very high. So, if you prepare enough, you can expect for B+ to A-.The workload is not intense at all. You only need to finish some hw online which can be solved right away.Systems of linear equations; vector spaces; linear transformations; matrix representation of linear transformations; linear operators, eigenvalues and eigenvectors; similarity invariants and canonical forms.Very good. The lecturer always reviewed the content before the lecture started and he can deliver the abstract concept into easier way which can make people much easier to understand what he taught. Moreover, he encouraged people ask question for better understanding.Systems of linear equations; vector spaces; linear transformations; matrix representation of linear transformations; linear operators, eigenvalues and eigenvectors; similarity invariants and canonical forms.I do not really know much about the instructor since i did not attend any lectures except the first one. At a glance, he did not seem to be effective.Linear equation systems
Matrix algebra
Determinants
Vector spaces and subspaces - bases, coordinates and dimensions
Eigenvectors, diagonalization
Inner product spaces, orthogonality

Interesting lessons with some basic theorems and they can be applied in real life.
If you studied m2 in DSE, this course can help you to understand more about matrix and determinant that you learnt before.

WeBWorK: 10%
Midterm Exam: 30%
Final Exam: 60%As it is summer term, each lecture last for 3 hours. For me, It is quite hard to stay focus for 3 hours.

The lecture note of Dr HO is full of words and in color. He explains each example in a systematical way and you can read the example by yourself to know more about the knowledge.

However you need to attain all the lessons in order to get his note. His taught the knowledge by writing out the things on paper and project them into screen. Personally, it is very clear but hard to catch up as the teaching time is limited in summer term.Linear equation systems
Matrix algebra
Determinants
Vector spaces and subspaces - bases, coordinates and dimensions
Eigenvectors, diagonalization
Inner product spaces, orthogonality, Gram-Schmidt process, least squares problems

Quite useful. At least better than calculus (from a CS student's perspective)Lee's lectures could get boring but that's not something uncommon. What's not good is that when you decides to self-study and read his notes, you find that there is 60-120 slides of text in each chapter that is not easy to understand.

In comparison, Wong Ka Yue's version is comparatively clearer and more intelligible. But then we dont really get to choose for this semester... oh well.The first half of the course which appeared on the midterm was relatively basic stuff about matrices such as using augmented matrices to represent linear systems of equations, basic matrix operations, determinants and linear independence.

The second half involved vector spaces, eigenvectors/eigenvalues, orthogonal bases and the least squares problem.

Although discussed near the end of the course, chapter 7, "Symmetric Matrices and Quadratic Forms", did not appear on the final.The teaching in the lectures was acceptable but I didn't really attend that many classes because I found it more efficient to read from the textbook.

I found the tutorials hard to follow and often got confused when the TA was explaining a problem.The content is decent, because this course has many applications, and this course hence, forms as a pre-requisite or a co-requisite for many other courses.The professor was very monotonous and did not explain anything very well. I would suggest that you go with Professor Lee. In fact, for my own preparation, I used his notes and lecture slides as they were way more detailed.The content is pretty good. Course content:
1. Linear Systems, Elementary Row Operations, Row Echelon Forms
2. Vector Spaces, Linear Combinations, Matrix Multiplication
3. Equivalent Forms and Solution Structure of Linear System, Linear Independence
4. Linear Transformations and Matrices
5. One-to-one, Onto Linear Transformations and Invertible Matrices, Determinants
6. Determinants, Elementary Matrices, Cramer’s Rule, Area, Vector Spaces

11. Similar Matrices, Diagonalization, Diagonalizable Matrices, Application to Differential Equations
12. Application to Differential Equations, Inner Product, Length, Orthogonality, Orthogonal Sets
13. Orthogonal Projection, Orthonormal SetsThe teacher is very boring.. Only reads from the slides, and the solves examples slowly on the board. It's pointless attending his lectures half the time. The tutorials were a lot more helpful in understanding the conceptsLinear Algebra using vectors and matrices. Difficult to understand the vector part but matrices are easy.
10% Webwork Homework
30% Midterm
60% Final
Mostly focus on final otherwise whole grade will go down.Boring, mostly self learning. Used many other resources to try to understand the concepts. The slide materials are old and not explanatory.The content cover a lots of vectors and matrix  calculation in terms of coordination operation.The teacher is boring but he taught everything in a very detail way.If you do the homework your own, the exam should be easy for you to achieve a good grade.
Basically you have to have 90+ to get A range, 80+ for B range and below would normally be C range.A few online homework assignment and a few quiz. I suggest you to spend more time on the home work because it would be very helpful for the quiz and examsThe topics covered in the course are quite interesting. Vectors, determinants and matrices make up the content of most of the chapters. As such, the topics and concepts are not very hard.One word: horrible. I strongly encourage to look for another instructor, I have heard good reviews about Liux Haixia and Lee Wing Lung, so I would recommend trying to get into their lecture sections. Wong Ka Yue (Daniel) is very monotonic and robotic, and not fun to listen or talk to at all. That, along with his strange way of talking and explaining make him one of the worst instructors I have encountered in UST. Avoid.Chap 1                                Systems of Linear Equations

MATRICES, VECTORSI skipped all the lessons becasue I can't follow the lecturer.Calculus. Half DSE-M2 stuff, half new things. Good luck if you are M1.
Here's a list(not complete) of non-M2 stuffs in this course:
Continuity, Differentiability, Intermediate Value Theorem, Mean Value Theorem, 'one-to-one' function, Solving problems with absolute functions, Sandwich(Squeeze) Theorem, Linear Approximation, Newton's Method, Critical Point, Rolle's Theorem, L'Hopital Rule, Reimann Sum, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus(A little more things than DSE M2)Dr. Lam's English is clear, and he is willing to answer student's questions. However, his writes on the whiteboard in a less organised way, so it's not easy to follow. The teaching pace is slow, and he put too much time on explaining the fundamental knowledge that both M1 and M2 and even DSE Maths core should have covered, especially functions... He should have put more efforts on new topics such as L'Hopital Rule and more...

Mr. Kong's tutorial is better, at least he can demonstrate the examples clearly and remind us some important steps/tips in solving problems.

I think attending tutorial is more important than attending lecture. I skip most lectures that teaches M2 stuff.Basic M2 stuff. You will get good grade if you have taken DSE M2.Since I took the course in Spring semester, there were more international students and the lecturer will talk a bit slower and use more time to express the questions.something basic about math, including drivarive, triangle function, inverse function, ratio and so on. they are relatively easy.The professor is careful and analyze problems clearly.And the PPT is also comprehensive so it is easy to understand the content.And she always answer every question vividly.The contents are pretty much summarized in the course description. However, if you think that since you've done Mathematics module 2 in DSE you won't have any problem -- you're wrong. It's an extension to M1 and M2. It might not cover as broad, but certainly deeper. It took quite a lot of work (drills and practice and memorization) for me, a biochemistry student, to master these topics. It would help quite a lot if you have a bunch of physics and mathematics major friends.
Maths professors might say otherwise, but up till now I find little use of the contents in my other courses and research lab projects. So if you ask me, it's not useful for life science guys, not in the first 2 years anyway. It's just something good to know.This course is as boring as it can get. Honestly it doesn't make the slightest difference academically whether you attend classes or not.  It does, however, grant you a few more hours of sleep at home/hall if you don't attend lectures, although you'd sleep in class anyway.
It might be useful to attend the tutorials though. Tutors work through examples with you, which is much more useful than just talking about the theories.Almost 80% of the content had been learnt if you study M2

Review (if there is time available)He is great if you understand his accentmany materials have been taught in M1/M2, so it will be easy for those who have taken M1/M2 before. You have to a maths brick book for your study too. Bless you!it varies a lot among profs. The pro side is that the tutorial is compulsory and it helps you to understand better.as there are many science and engineering students, business students will suffer :(  Study hard la..The average grade is C as i heard from!The workload is quite heavy. There is online homework and it counts attendance. The quiz and midterm are quite difficult.Content is similar to HKDSE if you learn M2, but I think M1 students can manage, since they already have the main skills and concepts for differentiation and integration, which is the biggest coverage of the course.
- Continuity
- Differentiation
- Integration
- Mean Value Theorem
- Intermediate Value Theorem
- Absolute Function
- Limit
- L'Hopital Rule
- Linear Approximation + Newton's Method
- Fundamental Theorem of CalculusNot very good, to be honest. The professor has a very quick pace when teaching, sometimes it's hard to catch up, especially for those who did not take M2 or who did not learn the concept before. The professor also expects you to know everything, therefore may skip some parts, and does not thoroughly explain the concepts.This is an introductory course in one-variable calculus. Topics include functions and graphs, limits of functions and continuity, derivatives and their applications, basic indefinite and definite integrals.

This course is quite difficult for those who don't have strong mathematics background or strong passion for math.Professor Li's teaching is quite boring and is not very helpful to our study as he always assumes everyone has strong mathematics knowledge so he is not willing to explain maths problems which he thinks as "easy". Many of his students skip his classes and attend another better professor, Professor LAM, Tsz Kin's classes as attendance will not be taken.Basically studied the whole course on my own. Alot of the concepts are similar to the maths you do in school, but don't let the professors way of teaching confuse your pre-existing knowledge.Terrible English. No idea what he was on about half the time. His explanations weren't helpful either.Before midterm, most of the content are about M2 in DSE. It's just added a little new knowledge on it. Midterm is quite easy and the mean will be reaaly high,but the questions are more difficult in the final.The instructor has passion on teaching, but it's quite boring since lots of topic taught in M2. The lecture may be skipped but not the tutorial.content is mostly m1/m2 stuff.
matrix and differentiation
not that hard but requires time to do ex.could understand nothing he says. basically doing self-study.
tried asking him a question and he totally ignored us.this is a required course with a lot of people studying.
grade turned out to be okay, even though I sucked in one of the mid-terms.
Average is not that high, around 5x%
u get marks for finishing webworks.There are webworks every week.  Must finish them to get marks.
two midterms and one final.introduction to calculus, limits, some rules of differentiation and integration.

not too hard if you have some basic understanding on calculus, reading the TA materials would help you understand most of the contents.Not really helpful to be honest, often can't hear what he's talking. so I end up skipping most of it, the notes and practices form TA are more helpful. The material from TA are also available online, so you can download all the practice and the solutions and skip the tutorials if you want.This course covers all the basics of calculus as well as some of the topics in the past AL Maths. Topics included are:
1. Definition of Functions (*)
2. Trigonometry
3. Limit of Functions
4. Continuity of Functions
4. Definition of Limit (not examined) (*)
5. Differentiation
6. Application of Differentiation, including
    I) Rates
    II) Linear Approximation and Differential (*)
    III) Newton's Method (*)
    IV) Maximum and Minimum Values
    V) Mean Value Theorem (*)
    VI) L'Hospital Rule (*)
    VII) Curve Sketching
    VIII) Optimization Problems
7. Antiderivatives
8. Definite Integrals
9. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

(Topics with asterisk are either topics from past AL Pure Maths or topics at university level)

This course might be too easy for students studied Mathematics M2 before (especially for those who get very good result in DSE exam) but too difficult for the students studied M1 before because many topics are new to them, thereby I would say the content fails to satisfy the needs of the students.Professor MOY use a lot of time to demonstrate the WebWork Problems. Although this approach might be good to the students who need a lot of help in the study, it is not really helpful to the students with better Maths background. His lecture is also very boring.

The TA, on the other hand, is much more helpful. He demonstrate the problems with very clear and concise logic, and is also very willing to answer the students' questions. But again, the tutorial is too boring for those people with better Maths backgroundMostly M2 stuff together with a few theorems related to derivatives, e.g. L'Hopital's Rule. mean value theorem, etc

Professor Lam clearly prepared thoroughly for class and could teach without drawing any reference to his notes throughout the whole lecture.mid-term exam and final exam
very difficult for those not good at A-level mathsonly teach you the easiest thing during the lecture but require you to answer the hardest thing during exam
suggest borrowing some textbooks from library to do more exercises after class if you want to get a nice or just average gradeThe content is very easy during the add-drop period, and then it gets harder. Because there is no ppt before the class, you have to attend the lectures and take notes. There is no assignment and project, no attendance is required, and overall the content is not very difficult.TK is patient and always makes things quite clear for everyone to understand. However, that makes him sometimes too slow to draw attention. He never uses ppt, so he writes in class and uses the projector. His writing is not always clear, which may be hard to recognize if you do not attend the lectures or pay full attention to what he says.calculus，

- Fundamental Theorem of CalculusExplaining very clea, but it’s little boringBasic calculus include differentiation, integration and others like function and inverse function. If you have taken M2 in DSE then there are not many new contents to you.Wang has some weird accent, but understandable. In lecture, he always prove the equations before introducing new chapters to us. Sometimes it is difficult to follow because he may use some techniques that are not include in the course scope. Before mid-term, he will go through pastpaper with us and that helped me a lot in my mid-term exam.
Leung Ho Ming is a great TA, his teaching style is exam-oriented, which fits me perfectly as i have already learn most of the cotent in high school M2. In his notes, he use many different example question to explain the techniques we can apply in different cases. There are also practice questions in his notes, you can have a try but they are pretty challenging.The content is very easy.
Most of the contents is just the same in the DSE M2.

You can skip all the class and just study the lecture notes is okay in the beginning as it is just repeated what you have learnt only

No attendance taking.
I skip most of the class hahaThe teaching is very good.
You can ask him any questions and he will answer you very clearly.Affordable for people who like Maths. Contents became difficult after mid-term.Attending tutorial classes is very important and the tutor was nice and taught me how to tackle the exam-problem types. They will talk in a more detailed way on how to solve the question. I skipped most of the lectures and attend tutorial class.Maybe demanding if u studied M1 in secondary school

No attendance was taken.She is kind but the class is boring.And the lecture notes are not enough for you to study by yourself.Boring,boring,and boring. just teach the titles and the questions. write the answers on the white board. Actually many students below is doing their own things .very limited A range!every assignment, it is quite normal but took a long time to type in and finish it. Sometimes there is something wrong with the home work system,so the answer may never be accurate. And there is sample exam before midterm and final.It's mainly M2 stuff with some extra topics. Should be manageable even if you studied M1.
- Continuity
- Differentiation
- Integration
- Mean Value Theorem
- Intermediate Value Theorem
- Absolute Function
- Limit
- L'Hopital Rule
- Linear Approximation + Newton's Method
- Fundamental Theorem of CalculusProf Lam is a nice guy but I really don't understand what he is trying to teach sometimes. He laughs at his own jokes and I think he intentionally makes mistakes so he can liven up the mood a little bit. Kinda weird, but I heard he's the best prof among the other math1013 professors. Just go to the tutorial sessions because you can do exercises and practice more problems. You can skip the lessons honestly they are not that useful. its basically the proof of some theorems.Detailed version of M2
The most difference is that computation is less important in this course.e.g.We do not know the function, just have some property .Therefore,everything should start from the definition to prove them.This instructor is good.The note is clear and well-organised.
Some supplementary ex. are provided for http://revision.It is harder and more advancing for clarify your concept.For those who have studied M2 in secondary school, there should be not a big deal. Limits, differentiation, curve sketching, integration.... which are just like M2 things but more detail and proof taught (although not required in exam). New things are just linear approximation, Newton's method, L'hopital's rule... which are some basic concept of differentiation actually.

However for those taking M1, good luck because u simply need to learn half the M2 syllabus in one semester.Mr. Lam taught in very detail and slowly. He is also willing to answer student's question in class or after class. His teaching is quite good and precise. But for M2 student it may be a little bit slow...

Most importantly, he will upload both his notes and handwriting notes to a website for people to download and see so even if you missed one or two, u could just learn it back yourself.From function to integration by substitution and include some new topic like Riemann sum, but mostly are the syllabus in secondary school. If u hv studied M2 before, it's not a big problem.No comment becoz I attended the first lecture only in the whole semaster. Tutorial depends on ur tutor.The content was actually very well organized as compared with other classes. Lecturer goes very systematically according to his slides and the textbook is well-aligned with class content.

However, there is a lack of exercise given by lecturer in class which makes practice for complicated contents inadequate.


If you suck at math, ain't nothing can help yo butt for A+ brahThe teaching style of professor is very orderly. There is always an explanation to every line in the notes and the professor will not skip any parts and always ensure his students pay attention in lessons. His major pet peeve is using the mobile phone in class.


If you suck at math, ain't nothing can help yo butt for A+ brahmostly m2 stuffs
a bit different for m1 students
have to pay effort to do exercises if you want to have good gradesnot bad but not clear English
the notes given is a bit messy and too much words so a bit difficult to get the key points
ta is good
always willing to explainAround 70% similar to DSE M2 content, including limit,differentiation,graphing function integration. Midterm should be okay for those who have studied M2. After midterm, new things are taught like Linear approximation and differentials,Mean value theorem,L'Hopital's ruleThe professor prove and explain every theorem, but a little bit difficult to hear what he is talking about because of his ascent. Handwritten notes are uploaded to canvas after each lesson. Can ask question in class or through canvas and he will answer during classIt’s not so hard for those who have already learned calculus in high schoolIt’s most about solving problems, however, it’s quite important to make sure that you’ve been to every tutorial lesson to get the problem lists and answers.If you attend most of the classes and be focus in class you can probably pass this course. But if you want a good grade you still need to do adequate practices. Some mid-term and final exam question comes from the content of class or tutorials.Just a few webworkMost of the contents are DSE level, if you have a good grade in DSE it should be very easy to handle.Voice of the lecturer is quite powerful to get you feel sleepy, I always fallen into sleep during lessons.Most of the time is self-study only attend lessons in first two weeks. My score just hit the mean which is around 70% and got a B-. I think it is fair enough.The workload is very reasonable just need to finish webwork, you can do it all at once before the deadline, just need a day can finish it.content was difficult, but the class is worth the effortpowerpoint notes are log and mundane, just like every single other ust course self study is impliedgradign was similar to that of UST standard, however, due to the diffiuclt content I suppose a lot of students didnt do well in the exams. It is important to finish the only maths assignment to get a pass, but those are not difficult if one seeks help from your friends and will be able to finish it.workload was not a lot, but self study is much requiredBasic calculus. Require only DSE level of M2 skill.The notes of the instructor are very useful. You can completely rely on the notes and do not need a maths book. The exercise is also enough for us to practise.Not as good as I expect. However, it is equal to the effort you have paid.It is acceptable. Need to complete an assignment every week. It is not enough to get a good gade just by doing the weekly assignment. You need to do the out of class exercise by yourself.The content is related to university students and really useful. In this course, you will study about Calculus IB, such as derivative and integral.YE, Guibo is a really good teacher and has a good English although she is from Mainland China. She always gives students to try to solve the problem, before she reveals the true answer. I would rate her A+ if I could.
However, the tutorial class is not satisfactory at all.content is similar to high school calculus. limits, function, differentiation, FTC, integration, Newton's Method, Critical Point, Rolle's Theorem, L'Hopital Rule, Reimann Sum etc.
it might be very difficult for you if you have a weaker understanding of how graphs work and how differentiation is related to graphs.
but be careful, for after the midterm, things start to get pretty hard. so slacking off would be a terrible idea.lectures are super boring. I almost fell asleep in every class. Professor goes through the ppt notes and solves the answer- that's it. no attendance required. But tutorials are pretty great. Dr Wang Jingjing's tutorial is great, so are the notes. just go through the tutorial notes on her website and you're good to go.not that difficult, secondary school level plus a little bit extra things.
M2 things, like integration, diffiriation, application of integration and so om.l miss most of the classes and study by myself. Even though l study by myself, l can learn that knowledge from youtube or khan academy. So, attending classes is not that essential.Chapter 1 Functions And Models
Chapter 2 Limits And Derivatives
Chapter 3 Differentiation Rules
Chapter 4 Applications Of Differentiation
Chapter 5 Integrals

If you study M1 in secondary school, you will find it quite hard to catch up because the content of this course is far more than what you have learnt in DSE.
Some special highlights: trigo differentiation, implicit differentiation, Mean Value Theorem, Curve sketching etc.Lam Tsz Kin is a very friendly teacher.
He uses various examples to talk about the concepts behind and is willing to answer students' questions.
However, what he teaches are not the question types or main points that the exam will cover.
Tutorial is more important.It's simple. Just some basic calculus. Such as functions, LH's rule, mean value theorem,  derivatives and antiderivatives, chain and inverse, and so on.I like TK Lam, he gave lots of examples, making it easy to understand. He also used many body language to express, which is really interesting. : )Basic mathematics staff for university study:
fuction, limits, continuity, differentiation and integration. M2 in secondary school covers some topics like limits, techniques and some application of differetiation and antiderivatives.Normal speed, not difficult to follow.
The examples in note are thought-provoking.
The instructor seems to be a bit nervous sometimesThe course is not very difficult if you keep study and do exercise

Calculus. Half DSE-M2 stuff, half new things. Good luck if you are M1.
Here's a list(not complete) of non-M2 stuffs in this course:
Continuity, Differentiability, Intermediate Value Theorem, Mean Value Theorem, 'one-to-one' function, Solving problems with absolute functions, Sandwich(Squeeze) Theorem, Linear Approximation, Newton's Method, Critical Point, Rolle's Theorem, L'Hopital Rule, Reimann Sum, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus(A little more things than DSE M2)Li Dong will not cover the basic content very much, he will spend most of the time discussing the difficult questions.The contents are based on the knowledge from DSE M!/M2.   As I've taken M1 in my senior form of secondary school, I think the content is not that hard to follow.The teaching is okay and he will provide extra online exercise to the whole class if you ask him. And the exercise is in quite good quality.The grading is acceptable but you have to pay effort. As this course is absolute grading, the more effort you pay, the higher grade you can get. It just depends on how hard-working you are.the workload is not very heavyAn introduction to some basic concepts and simple applications of calculus, including basic functions, limits, continuity, derivatives, linear approximations and Newton's method, mean value theorem, L'Hopital's rule, integrals and their applications.

This course concentrate more on the applications rather than the strictly logical structure of math. For example, strict definitions of the concepts as well as proofs of some theorems are not required. In this way, this course was poor in depth of math. Instead, problem-solving in daily or engineering or business circumstances serves as a big part of teaching, hw, and exams.Dr. Lam is easy-going and helpful, but has a slight English accent.
Nothing more I could comment on, for I had only attended 2 lectures this semester. X)The course is so disorganized, making it unnecessarily difficult to learn a material that has largely been taught in most countries' high school. But I heard some teachers and TAs are very well organized and provides lecture notes that are very helpful, I was just unlucky I guess.Her english pronunciation needs work, and its a bit difficult to pay attention to her for extended periods of time. But she tries and you can always come to her after class for questions, or you can make an appointment to meet with her before exams. Overall she's a nice person but not a great teacher.(This is more accurate for students from mainland and Taiwan) I learned most of the content in high school. All I needed to do is to memorize the English vocabularies of the mathematics concepts. A class that cost me almost no time :)The teacher is very nice, patient and willing to listen to students' questions during class. He always writes down everything he says, and upload the notes on canvas, so it is totally the same to listen to the lecture and read the notes on my own. He speaks fluent Cantonese, Mandarin and English, so there is no language barrier when interacting with him!Calculus. Half DSE-M2 stuff, half new things. Good luck if you are M1.
Here's a list(not complete) of non-M2 stuffs in this course:
Continuity, Differentiability, Intermediate Value Theorem, Mean Value Theorem, 'one-to-one' function, Solving problems with absolute functions, Sandwich(Squeeze) Theorem, Linear Approximation, Newton's Method, Critical Point, Rolle's Theorem, L'Hopital Rule, Reimann Sum, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus(A little more things than DSE M2)cannot understand, so i didnt attend all lessons. And the professor usually out focus, and teach something out syllabus, and i cannot focus on the course materialThe content is quite useful and fundamental. Unfortunately, I do not have M2 background so I have to be very hardworking in order to understand the math concept clearly.Instructor is new. He do not know how to use canvas so he never upload ppt. Also, his class is extremely boring. He wrote on the whiteboard but the writing is very small. Nearly Nobody can see. So i skip all the lecture.

TA is very very very good. He is able to make students understand all the concept needed for examination, with nothing more. Good for those who want good grades but not that love math.I studied M1 in DSE
contents of this course is simply the advanced version of M1 except a few
So don't trust anyone if they tell you that you're gonna get rekt by students who studied M2 in DSE
This course is not hard at all
I didn't go to any of the classes except for the first three weeks and I only did revision one day before the mid-term and final. It turned out to be a closely A- B+Sorry I didn't attend many lectures to tellLargely related to M2 in high school with additional knowledge. In the exam will be mainly focus in those newly taught knowledge. Such as Newton's method ,squeeze theorem ,L’Hospital’s rule and Intermediate value theorem.Mr Lam teaching is kinda boring and sometimes made mistakes in his teaching without knowing it. However if you brain can't run fast, Mr Lam will be ur best choice because he speaks slow.
Mr Hu teaching is absolutely awful, he can't speak English well and hardly understand what he is saying. But his notes and supplementary materials are useful for exam and he is nice to answer your questions. And please do not take his course.Mainly M2 related things with a little bit of M1 stuff. A lot of M1 students struggle with it because they do not even have basic dse knowledge of M2 so I feel like this course does not take into account the needs of different students.Teaching is good since the concepts are well-explained with details and the professor is really patient and helpful and is willing to answer any question you have. The tutorials in my opinion are more useful than lectures as they explain stuff with more details. Lectures seem quite useless since you will not understand and you cannot ask questions directly.DSE M2 stuffs, including functions, limit, differentiation, and a small part of integration.
I studied M1 for my DSE, but 1013 is not that hard for M1 students, you just have to learn the derivates and integrals of trigonometric functions and nothing more.
For limit, we have to check whether the limit exist with just looking at its left-hand and right-hand limit, not that hard but would be a bit strange at first since it is different form what we have learnt in high school.
For differentiation, nothing special, very standard differential calculus.
For integration, this course will only cover from common integrals to u-substitution only, either M1 or M2 students should be familiar with it. The only thing new to M1 students is integrating trigonometric functions.
No any rigorous definitions are covered in this course, if you are interested in maths, you should take 1023 instead.Dr. Hu is very nice, questions are always welcomed. He always stays until 1830 to answer students' questions where the class is ended at 1750.
He would remind you to do webwork before the deadline.
But his classes are quite boring, it seems like he is doing maths by himself but shouting it out only. Also, his english pronunciation is drastically poor, i could barely understand what he is talking about without looking at his handout.
He writes on the papers with the visualizer projecting his handwriting during classes, they are just content from textbook.
-
He would upload a ppt file on canvas after each lesson, it would be a digital form of his handout, look at it when you don't understand his handwriting.
He would also upload a check list for what you should know before the final exam, it is ABSOLUTELY USEFUL for your revision.
-
He also taught something that are out of syllabus, such as the epsilon-delta language (in the syllabus of 1023) and topology (his research area). If you are not gonna take maths as major, just ignore it is ok. It won't be examined.Basic Math / Calculus. Found it to not be horrible, as the material overlapped with a lot of math from high school (ie. derivatives/inverse functions/differentiation/etc..)Great professor who is very eloquent and capable of speaking english. Knew about the topics in depth, and is really good at iterating through concepts. Accent can be tough at times, but their competency in the subject and clarity when teaching makes it worth going to lecture. Would definitely recommend taking it with this prof.75% DSE M2 contents, eg limits, differentiation, integration.
25% new contents, eg Linear approximations, Newton's Method, Mean Value Theorem, L'Hopital's rule...Instructor is from mainland so HK students may hard to hear what he said because of his accent.
Always ask students whether he is correct or not and he sometimes cannot answer student's questions.
Sometimes randomly pick students to answer examples in the lesson.M1 M2 stuff mostly M2 thoughGreat. Swapped to this class at add/drop and found that he is way better at explaining the concepts than the other professor that i attended.Absolute grading. I got 5* in DSE M1 and A- in this math course. My final score is 86.xx It seems to have a better grade for M2 student given that the content is mostly M2 stuff. According to professor Lam, the cutoff score is not integer as stated and getting 90 would be an A.I would say it is moderate as it is M1 student can followed up without much difficulty much less M2 student.Most topics are covered in HKDSE M2
Limit, differentiation and application, integration
Some are not taught in M2(or just a little), including:
Function, continuity, differentiability, definition of integration (Riemann Sum), intermediate value theorem, mean value theorem
Basically, it is a very easy course as you have learned most of the content in secondary school
But the most important difference (not related to content but worth mentioning) is that NO calculator is allowedDr Hu's pronunciation is not very good, but normal students should have no problem to follow what he said in the lecture
Sometimes talk about contents not required in the course (eg rigorous definition of limit, application of IVT using example in topology), but just forget what he said is okay
Vey willing to answer students' questions, no matter face-to-face or by emailEveryone who studied M1/M2 needs to take this course.
Basically most are M2 materials.
Some new concepts included such as L'Hopital's Rule, implicit differentiation and inverse function.Do not reg this professor!!! He speaks so fast like he assumes you know everything to be taught in class. I have no clue for what he is talking during lesson. Going to tutorial section and doing exercise by yourself is definitely more useful than going to lecture session.U can find it here.
http://www.math.ust.hk/~tklam/Math1013

Students aced M2 in dse should have no problem at least for midterm. Most of them are included in dse curriculum.
Final is quite difficult though even for M2 students.The lecturer spoke softly so students at the back may not hear clearly.
The lecture is easy to follow but the notes as he demonstrated step by step.
The lecture notes uploaded is quite messy though, it takes time to follow if u miss the class.

For the tutorial class, we went through WebWork and midterm questions.
He faced to the board all the time and u need to prepare the questions print-out so as to know what he is doing.
So I think it is ur personal decision on whether attending the class.
He sent email quite often so that we can have the latest information anything related to the class. It is easy to find him although I have never find him.Week 01:

For M1 students, the course is hard af!Li Dong's teaching is so difficult to understand. Lam Tsz Kin is much better.very basic stuff covered in dse m1/m2, as well as some new concepts and theorems which is fundamental in calculus including squeeze theorem, l'hopitals rule and fundamental theorem of caluclusvery detailed explanation at a reasonable speed, with quite a lot of examples explaining different concepts and theoremsVery basic stuff, functions, limit, differentiation and its application, IVT, MVT, and basic integration, just Riemann sum and substitution. I believe more half of it is covered in M2.Honestly I do not really attend lesson that much, even if so, I am just playing with my laptop. However he taught quite good according to my classmate. The tutorial section provide a lot of exercise and the tutor post them online along with the solution which is great in my opinion.- Number, inequalities and absolutes, basic functions and graphs, composite functions, exponential function.

Since few weeks before final, lessons with only notes and remarks written on the board, without using any powerpoint.
Teaching is super fast, making everything confusing and assuming that you have known everything.
I am a M1 student and he is teaching stuff that even M2  students have no idea on it, and assuming it was taught in high school for everyone.
I can feel his passion and love towards math, but his teaching really sucks.
If you can master everything in 1013 before having lessons, just feel free to reg Li Dong, he will give you many challenging questions.Calculus. Half DSE-M2 stuff, half new things.Mr Wang's English is not clear , it is hard to hear what has been said. And he sometimes cannot finish the examples and ask the students whether he is correct or not.

For tutorials, it is better if comparing to the teaching of lectures,
Tutor first explain the theorem then do some examples to give students a better understanding and it is easy to follow. Also, tutor is willing to answer and explain questions.The content is fair if you studied M2 in secondary school. The content is similar to what you have learnt in M2.  I have to say the content itself is not so difficult, but the exam is another thing(the so-called past paper is of little use, completely different from the real one)To be honest, the teaching is quite boring. He tends to use the whiteboard. So, you have to have your paper prepared.This course is intended to those who studied M1/M2 in the secondary school. It goes back to all the basics of calculus and introduce some minor excluded topics in M1/M2 syllabus, like L'Hopital rule, absolute value inequality and limits, differentiation on weird functions, etc.
In general the content is not difficult, but you may find the workload a bit more if you studied M1 in your secondary school life.The Professor just speaks whatever she wrote on the lecture notes. There is no need to attend this professor's lecture as you could already knew what she is about to say.
Tutorial maybe useful to who has M1 background, but in general feel free to skip the whole courseSome basic dy/dx, after that, is lots of hard stuff that most business student will never understand, and so meaninglessLecture teach you the basic and the theory of the equation, but how on earth are we suppose to be interested if we don't even understand the equation?

Tutorial is a must attend if you want a passIn-depth version of what we've learn in high school.
The content is actually not that hard, but the professor makes everything so confusing, and the calculus part is much similar to M2, like cotangent, so M1 calculus has no help in this programme.
Very confusing for M1 students, especially the one who are good at probabilities more than calculus.
(Me: DSE M1 Lv.5)SUPER FAST!!!!
Goes over the slides so quickly that its impossible to follow.
The professor expects you to know everything before so didn't explain much.Mostly are M2 stuff, some content is just appeared in Advanced Level Pure Mathematics, generally it is not too difficult to handle.
Content:
Week 1 Review of the concepts of functions and graphs.  
Week 2 Elementary functions.
Week 3 Tangent and velocity; the limit of  a function and limit laws.
Week 4 Continuity; limit at infinity; limit definition of derivative and rates of change.
Week 5 Derivatives of basic functions; differentiation rules.

Week 10 Curve sketching; optimization problems.
Week 11 Antiderivatives; areas and distance travelled.
Week 12 Definite integrals; Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Week 13 Net change; substitution rule.Mr Lam will start the most basics topic is the first week. The progress is rather slow and You may think it is a little bit easy, but his teaching can help you clear some concepts rather than just memorize the steps.
He is willing to ANSWER to your questions after lectures. All of his examples and written notes will be uploaded to his website after one week, so you dont need to worried in case you dont attend to his lectures. Generally speaking, he is a nice guy so dont feel afraid to ask them maths questions. Well............he always laughs during his lessons when he made mistakes......

It is worth to attend all tutorial section, there are useful notes and the TA will demonstrate the example one by one, moreover, there are many exercises for you to do, which is similar to exam type questions.I went to all professors' lessons and i think LAM Tsz Kin is the best one. Most of the knowledge is learnt in the secondary school by students who take M1/M2 and the homework is not too much. So it is just a review of secondary stuffs and easy for most of students to handle. Even though i skipped many lessons because my home is far away from ust, i still got a not bad grade in the mid-term and final examination.No CommentIf u have study M2/M1, it is easy. Just some M1/M2 stuffs + some university things. More about pure maths. try hard about itDepends on tutor. Actually need sources from classmates. They can give u many past paper for if u cannot attend any lectures or tutoria, just use the other classmate's notes. The ppt is also very fluent.Basic calculus with some real life applications. The class doesn't go deep in terms of content. It rather covers wide range of topics and goes over them quickly.Students need some background education before taking the class in order to fully understand the instructor.Picky about small things. However, if you are able to explain your way of thinking in a reasonable way then the instructor might be more lenient.Not so much as a math class, but does take some time to complete it. Some assignments are also very time consuming.The content is easy. It's friendly to people who just begins learning calculus. If you go to classes and do the exercise on your own, mastering the content shouldn't be difficult.The teacher mostly just repeat the ppt. In some sessions it's not very necessary to go to the classes.-calculus is a very good math foundation course, students have taken mathematics module 2 will have favor in this course.Very good and interesting! he is the best in calculus math 1013,
i do think freshman should learn math 1013 from mr lam. Really a good course, i recommendok la, it is a basic course, grading average. but to be honest, it is mainly depends on your competitor.simple workload, not much, only few assignments and examination. btw i do recommend student should do more exercise to secure a better gradeThe content is quite comprehensive, From the principle of first derivative to the differentiation is included in the course. You will learn more deeply compared to M2 learned in HKDSEThe professor is quite boring. More in-deep materials should be searched in the internet by yourself.Not too much for student who have studied M1/2

Can skip the lessons since self-learning is fasterIf you can still remember what you have learnt in secondary school, studying by yourself is not a great problem for some topics.Rubbish! CAI is a new professor. He like turning the light  in the classroom at the dimmest mode, resulting in everyone slept. He just simply read aloud the notes, nothing can learn in the lecture.Too much things to learn in one semester! Especially for those who didn't have a thorough understanding of derivative in secondary school.The lecturer is from mainland, so don't expect any pleasant accent. And I skipped most of the lectures, mainly revise at home and read the lecture notes. If lecture notes aren't clear enough can read through the text book.M2 students should be familiar with half of the topics included. Most topics are new to M1 students.
Topics included in this course:

TA To Tsz Chung's teaching is quite useful for the exams and he gives many examples and exercises.This course include half of the content in DSE M2, including limits, differentiation and some basic integration skills (volume calculation not included). M1 students may find it a bit difficult as there are some trigo d/in.This professor always end his lesson late for 5-10 minutes, be careful if you have other lesson afterward. Notes are provided and uploaded to CANVAS.Mostly M2 stuff of HKDSE in this course with some new concepts. It would be pretty complicated if you didn't take M2 in secondary school. The course is about fundamental theory of calculus, differentiation, integration,continuity, etc.The demonstration of calculus concept is so ambiguous. And the lecturer sometimes shifts the focus too often and completely lost me. Tutorial helps a bit. but the exercises are quite different from the problems in the exams.The content is very basic calculus. A start for bigger mathematic world.If you want to learn more, learn something by yourself or try 1024.Prof. CAI always teaches by reading his notes. It might be boring to listen to, but he sometimes gives some interesting prove problems.Grading is good. You can get A range if 90%.The workload is not heavy. Every week a homework which can normally be done in 90min. May need to do some past paper before midterm and final. There are many problems in same patterns, so it's really helpful to do some pastpaper.Content was okay since most materials were covered in high school.Not very good style of teaching, most of the time he actually only discussed questions from webwork on his lectures.No attendance. Questions on midterm and final are very difficult, very different from those of webwork, so try to earn full points of participation from webwork. Tip for mid term: Try to find some pastpapers, they actually helped as some of the questions are actually the sameHave to do the webwork to get 15% of the final grades. Some questions posted on webwork are difficult but you have unlimited tries.This is an introductory course in one-variable calculus. Topics include functions and graphs,
limits of functions and continuity, derivatives and their applications, basic indefinite and definite
integrals.Dr. Lam teaches great. He will explain concepts slowly so to make sure student can follow.

In tutorials, the TA will teach again what had been taught in lectures and had explained example questions.HIs notes are quite well-detailed, with steps and answers provided. However, his lessons are quite boring and his tone is dull.His teaching is not bad though.It really depends on how much time you devoted in this course and whether you have studied M2 or not. As the content is mainly about M2 maths, so if you have studied M2 before, it will be a comparative advantage for you. However, if you studied M1, it is also fine as long as you have done revision.The workload is not heavy. Only one webwork need to do on every week.the content is quiet easy in my view and it just covers what you have learnt in high school. there is no need to spend more time on this for an engineering student .the instructor is quiet humorous. sometime he may  makes a funny mistake deliberately.  he always try to use some example which is familiar to us to introduce what he want to teach.Half of the contents have been learnt in high school and only one midterm and final. The syllabus is not really intense.Lots of extra examples have been used in lecture, no attendance requirements, no quizzes, no projects and the prof. is also a nice guyAbsolute grading where 85% to 100% A range, 70% to 85% B range, never revise before the midterm and final, but midterm and finals were more difficult than the textbooks questions.1 Webwork per week, most of the answers of the questions can be found online even through the numerical values are differentmentioned by other people already, and I agree with them
m1 people like me need to self-study some partsThis is the first course prof ye teach in ust
her pronunciation is hard to understand at first, but soon we can understand
her notes although is hand-written, her penmanship is quite good and it summarized all stuff in the book, so read her notes before exam and no need to buy the book
dont judge her by the first lesson

moy is a fair prof, nothing specialSome advanced content like hkdse m2, some algebra and graphsNo CommentThe A range is really hard to get that the score of midterm and final have to be at least 85+, I got 77 in midterm and 88 in final still got only B+Basically only homework which is some good exercise for exams because it really helps building up the concept of the topics. Sometimes might have some online bonus quizs that everyone wil do so. Not really high loaded as long as you know how to do the homework.Mainly about the things students learned in high school, and some theorems, differentiation and a little bit about integration. Overall, students can generally get most of the idea of the topics.Teaching is good and clear. Tutorial is useful. Students must finish the worksheet and do revision after that. If you have any question about the topics, you can ask the professor.I have studied M1 in DSE before, so I found the content was quite demanding as it is mostly included in M2 syllabus but not M1's.She only copied the book content as her teaching material with exactly the same examples in the book.It is using absolute grading so you do not need to worry about the competitors. Scoring 85% or above can get an A range, 70%-85% for B range.You only need to do Webwork as assignment but I think it is indeed quite useful for revision. There is a total of 9 webwork for my semester and each webwork consists of around 15 questions on average.i got 5* in both M2 and Maths.But Math1013 is totally a different thing. Its very hard to understand all the things even though you study well at your secondary school.The concept is very far away from the knowledge you learnt from secondary school. And also the integration and deviation are not familiar to what you have learnt. The lucky thing you should thank god is that the workload of this course is light. and also you do not need to attend the tutorial class , though it is very useful.The teacher seems like having no idea about what he is saying.This course mainly teaches limits, derivatives, differentiation and integration. However, students who have studied Math Module 2 in the HKDSE syllabus have more advantages than students who have studied Math Module 1 as the content of the two subjects are more similar. Attendance is not required for both lectures and tutorial sessions, but I will suggest you to attend both, especially the tutorial sessions, as handouts will be distributed.The professor who taught me did not provide any notes to students during lectures, therefore I jotted all the things he had written on the whiteboard. Luckily, the notes in tutorial sessions are quite useful.If you study m1 in Secondary school, this course is good for you to learn more about mathematics.The main problem is that her pronunciation is hard to understand, so you will get bored on her lesson. I can't afford me to sleep at her lesson. Her lecture note is hand write, but fortunately it is easy to understand and learn, so you just need to learn from her lecture notes.just some basic calculus. 80% of the content is covered by the secondary school syllabus. So if you studied M2 in secondary school, you will have a great advantage in taking this course. However, if you were non-local or non m2 student, you will have a quite large lag behind starting comparing to those who study m2 in secondary school. So if you didnt study m2, its better to learn it before taking this course or find a friend that good at calculus. this course doesnt have attendance record.basically no teaching tehniqueQuite hard for those who did not take M1/M2 in DSE, not competitive in class and hard to catch uo the sysllabus.Different teacher have different pace, notes are provided. Tutorial classes are provided for small class teaching so it is easier to understand the topic comparing to in lectures.The course starts from function and goes deep to limit, derivative, simple integral. It only touches the superficial concept of calculus and its application. All you need to know is how are the concepts working instead of how did they come from.Dr. ZHU graduated from Oxford University and has a very clear concept of mathematics. He emphasizes the importance of definition. Being a friendly and enthusiastic instructor, he is always willing to help when the students are in need. He teaches hard and his shirt always gets wet at the end of the class. Meanwhile, he likes to hang around when asking you to solve the given problems and tries to find out if anyone is in need of help. He is also a responsible person. During a conversation after class, he told me that he could not sleep well before the days that he would give lectures. He said he was always afraid of oversleeping although this never happend.
Mr. LI was the TA. He was also the TA for many courses like MATH 2351. Unlike Prof. ZHU, his tutorials were so boring that I just attended two and played with my phone! All he did was reading the material notes line by line. :(never read the note and I don't understand what is going on. If you never talk a M2 course at high school, you will very hard o understand every thing.never go to the LT after attend two week. They will think you should already know the basic thing and skip lot of thing. you may need to buy some high school book to read and understand what is going onMost of the content is taught in secondary school, so it's a very easy course. The materials are well-prepared, especially the tutorial notes. The textbook is not required at all.
Attendance is not required. In fact, I only attended two lectures (the first one and the last one) and the last two tutorials. If you have already learned the content before, the lectures won't help you a lot.Judging by the two lectures I attended, I think the teaching was easy to understand. The professor is very patient with students. By the way, he always replied my email in two minutes, which is really nice!
The tutorials are known to be very helpful, so please attend them. The teaching assistant can answer a lot of questions after the tutorials. If you don't want to attend anyway, please print those tutorials notes by yourself and do the exercises, or you will deeply regret it in the exam.about half of the content is the same with m2 syllabus in dse.Quite clear. He used a lot of simple example to teach us. He is quite funny tooit is absolute grading. You can get a better grade under this system as quite a lot of students get really high marks in this course. Other than doing webwork, you need to do far more exercise in order to get a good grade.you only need to do webworks once a week or once in two weeks and there is unlimited attempt. but some questions may have bugs.Basic one-variable calculus. Functions and limits are covered. Rules of differentiation are taught to compute derivatives. Riemann sum and some basic integral calculus are introduced at the end of the course. Most of the content are covered by the M2 syallabus so the course should be easy for those who have taken M2 in DSE.The content of the course are organised neatly and the order of the course content is arranged logically. Most student should be able to understand majority of the course content.

The instructor is nice and he is willing to answer students' questions after class. The TA is also very helpful and her notes distributed on tutorials are good materials for preparing exams.The content are mostly about calculus and graphs.The spoon feeding teaching style is extremely boring, the professor will only stick to the lecture notes without giving extra examples. On the other hand, the tutorials are quite useful as the tutor will explain the concepts thoroughly and comprehensively, also the tutor provides more examples and practicing questions.The content is with well structured and planned. Definitions and examples are well provided. Most of them are already taught in IB Math SL courses.She's fine in teaching, desctibing well in class. However, the contents that she's taching is just the copy of the PPT. In other words, her PPT is well structured.Lots of students do already have a basic understanding in math. Thus it is hard to get a good grade.About 8 or 9 webwork-quizes are given. Each webwork quize contains 10 questions. No other homeworks are requested.dse m2 stuff
Form 4 curriculum
just few new termsquite boring
not to have a class at 9:00
you will fall asleep
in the mid of semester, you will lie on bed rather than have the lesson.it will be easier for the student who has taken math module 2 during secondary school. And it is difficult for the student without any knowledge of m2 to catch up the schedule of the lecturelam tsz kin explain the equation quite well and the tutorial is taught by einstein. he has quite a lot quesion which will definitely help you in understanding the theoryLimits and calculus (differentiation and integration)
First principle and L'hospital rule, linear approx. and newton's method, Riemann sum and definition of integration using right riemann sum.Average teaching, class at 09:30, couldn't wake up, go to LSK and attend a boring lecture. Mostly go to tutorial and get notes from the TA.For someone who studied M1 in dse may find it is a little difficult to catch up because of trigo, but it is still ok if you spend some time on them. And there is tutorial class once a week and it has provided many exercises, finish all of them is enough to understand the content. There will be sample paper for mid-term and final, it is a must to do them because they are very similar to the real exam.Well teaching, I like his teaching very much. He gave many examples in the class to help students to understand the topics. He is also able and willing to answer students' questions and discuss with them.Tentative Learning Schedule

Textbook
J. Stewart, Calculus Early Transcendentals, 7th edition, Brooks/Cole.

A req math course for all engine, sci students
Some BBA students (Qfin, Gbus) may hv to take thz as well

To be honest, this course may not be suitable for students with M1 background.
In my observation, they seemed to hv difficulty to catch up.
Maybe because they suffered from the stupid dse system,
causing them get used to just a brief understanding on the opration, but not the reasoning behind the whole mechanism
Thus they may only acquire a limited skills in the exam if they did not put much effort in it

But even for M2-ers, they are not actually benefited much
although they may hv more exposure on caculus during their study in high schools
Before the midterm,
they may only need to know more about limit.
For instance,
they may hv to learn to find a limit of a function involving abs sign at a specific point by considering the graph
They may also need to know how or in what ways the limit laws work,
or maybe acquire different skills to link up lim and dy/dx in different situations (e.g. "advanced" first principle：Left lim = right lim)
And that's all
And then they could just skip the lessons before the midterm
(given the fact that in this sem only content taught in week 1 to 7 were included in the mid term exam)

But after the midterm,
every local-ers just suffer in the same way.
All those fancy stuffs in week 8 and 9 suddenly just kick ur axx hard.
It taught me a lesson:
It would be terrible for u to skip lessons just after the midterm exam.

After that,
everything seemed to go on more normally.
For M2-ers they may only need to re-pick up skills on all those familiar question relating to optimization and sketching.

Then there is another tough time for everyone.
When integral sign is involved,
everything we learnt before just mix together.
From the little x on the upper bound to the FTC
From FTC we revised once more the chain rule
From lim + integral sign to 0/0, leading us to that "cute" LH rule,
once again suddenly bring up FTC
And finally,
the boss abs sign would just show up from nowhere to skrew up everything,
causing u lost faith in ur integration skills...

sor for the long bullshxt...
Wht i want to say is,
even u enter this u with 5** in m2/math or both,
u still need to work hard.
Maybe u hv confidence in ur ability to learn/pick up/acquire those skills,
u still hv to pay attention on how the whole things work and how they would appear to strike u backTK Lam is a good prof
He can explain Every details in a organised and systematic way
But still One minor thing i want to raise up here:
He may just be too careful to explain everythings,
make people feel confused in which part they should focus more
and thus cause students forget to think clearly in wht way all these could be applied in the real-world exam problems.

The tutor, Tommy Cheng, also did a great job.
He would try to include every necessary skills and techniques in 1hr tut/week
In the make-up session held in the sem break,
he even distributed to us a worksheet with excellent questions that never appear in other tutors' handouts.
Those 4 limit questions was just too great for us
to revise all the applicable theories we hv to know in the evaluation of limits

5.5 Substitution rule,her teaching is quite difficult to understandI hate math a lot and I dont understand why is it compulsory for m1/m2 takers in dse. The syllabus is way too difficult for me.A teacher with heart and passion, willing to answer questions raised by students. But quite boring as he just wrote everything on the whiteboard and explained in a solemn tone.Very basic calculus, remember to answer/prove with the name and formula of theories taught as that contributes to 1-2 points in each sub-question. Try not to skip tutorials, but lectures are totally ignorable.Dr Cai, what do I start with *sigh*. Basically only rewrote the lecture notes uploaded to CANVAS once during lectures, not much other than that. I only went twice the whole semester, self-studied the lecture notes.
Btw I asked him to upload the MC answers but after the checking of the final exam paper, they're still nowhere to be seen.Yes, very easy course. But It is so meaningless and wasting my time because >90% things have learnt in M2. I am strongly hope HKUST change the official rule to let all student who got level 5 or above in HKDSE M2 transfer MATH1013 and starting from MATH1014.Extremely bad teaching. In the lecture and tutorial class, the instructor like hidden! The tutors in MSC are very rule!The midterm paper questions are quite similar with the past paper. The final exam is easier than the midterm exam. The questions in webwork are too easy. If you want to have a good grade, must do more exercise.Fong Tsz Ho is a good teacher. He explained the concept deeply. He has prepared midterm review and final review for students and it is really useful.the course only includes a little content of M1 and M2, most of them are new to studentsbored, but Mr. Lam is a passionate and patient teacher, he is willing to explain the questions that you don't understandyou can get a good grade if you work really hard, however, never try to skip the webwork, otherwise, your grade will be very low. besides, if you fail in the midterm, it is difficult to get a good grade even you get a good result in final exam.not too much workload, one webwork per two weeksBasic M2. Should be an easier ride for those of you who've taken M1/M2 before. If you have passed them by receiving credit transfer? Too bad, it wont be easy if you've have forgotten what you've learned before.Honestly speaking, whether to attend lectures or not totally depends on you. Because? Well, the lecture itself does not help you at all. If might give a little help if you are taking this course without any pre-requisite knowledge.
Tutorial sessions may help you a little. They provide some useful examples to help you understand. Of couse, the level of difficulty is way lower then what appears in the exams.Basic knowledge about the math. Everyone who has the basic concepts about the math can handle this course easy.Never wen to the class. So don't know the teaching method. But I think the math support center is very useful. If you have some problems then the TAs would like to help you. Besides the webwork, other questions are also OK.The content just like DSE M2 but the notes had more explanation in each topicsTA taught the math questions step by step, very detailed
It is free to go to different tutorial sections as much as you want to get different notesnot very good if you do not do the practice provided in the tutorial class and it would be better to do extra practiceHave midterm, final and webwork
To answer the questions in webwork, google search can help if you do not know how to calculateIt just teaches M2 in 3 months, taken M2 before, not too difficult, otherwise, tough to remember the content quickly and hard to catch up.It is kind of boring. He taught by using the WebWork questions as example, where he show all the steps, most simple very slowly, making the lecture boring and slow.The content is too easy for mainlands, most of which we have learnt in high school. Even for the other parts which we haven't learnt, it's easier than the calculus class in almost every mainland university.Fine. The professor is really patient. Although the pace is too slow.M2 stuff. Will be challenging if you don't have M2 background.Backgroud:
-This is the first year she teaches in hkust, said she had 7years of teaching experience in the US.
-Her English pronunciation is just above the line of understandable.
Lecture:
-The lecture is super boring. She just read out what was on the notes.
-No need to answer questions
Tutorial:
-Tutorial is useful and more interesting than lecture.
-Teaches the same stuff as lecture does
-Don't skip tutorialThe content of this course is not difficult.Teaching styles of each instructor is different. You can borrow notes from other students if it suits you.Grading is  fair enough as long as you finish all the web work and do exercise.Workload isn't much. Just about 10 web work. There is also some out-class exercises and bonus quiz. You should complete the example quiz first for the bonus quiz is much similar to the example. Finish the exercise and past paper. It is important to know the example questions which may occur in the exams.About M2 stuff learnt in high school, with deeper explanation and deduction processes. Good for people who have learnt M2, but not M1.explain in detail, but a bit boring sometimes. Good for students who love Math and want to learn more about calculus and mathematical deductions.Quite bad as the exam and midterms are difficult. You might need more revisions to get good concepts on math theories, especially on graph sketching chapters.Web work is quite time-consuming. But other than that, no other extreme time-consuming workload. Revision depends on yourself.Basic calculus. Students with M1/M2 should be at least OK with that. Taught high school maths in first 2 lessons.Tries to be funny which, in case, is not, but nice effort.
Explains in details with graphs. Talks relatively slow but you can have more time in understanding. Therefore, he is sometimes boring when you get the concept fast. If you still don't understand, feel free to ask him after class. He will stay there for a while. Seems to be easy-going.Studying calculus. It will be difficult for students who haven't  studied    M1/M2.Boring mostly. I didn't really listen to the lecturer because it was boring. The lecturer is not a good speaker and students who have no calculus base may have the concept mixed up.It is just a course teaching M2 Maths in HKDSE.
Should be easy for those who have studied that.Boring teaching with interesting maths. Lecturers are kind of the same in all lecture, all teach in a boring way.For a person to get a C+ without any knowledge in M2, I think for grading part, it is not bad. For those who have studied it, it would be much better.For the online Webwork, you need to do it every single week. It should be easy for those who have studied M2 before to finish it.Calculus, conducted in a small class, professor will be covering the contents at the beginning of the class, after that, you will have a in class exercise to complete. The time for you to complete the exercise is limited. But meanwhile you can ask as many questions as you want, there will be lots of TAs around for you to ask questions if you have any. Then after a short break, you will have to complete a in class quiz (one quiz per class), you will not be able to ask questions during this time, so learn the stuff when you are doing the in class exercise.In the Winter semester, the class structure is quite different from what it originally is. There will be lots of TAs around for you to ask questions, and in every class you will have to do a set of questions. All the TAs are friendly and happy for you to ask question. Do not hesitate to ask them questions they are happy to help! Sometimes if you have some questions in mind, you can even discuss it with the professor, it can be quite fun. In my opinion, I learn much more effective this way.not hard just basic stuff
quite useful
different from dse maths
have m2 then okProfessor is great and is willing to help out each student. After explaining the materials he usually gives a few exercises and looks around the class to make sure that the students are able to do the exercises. His power point is also very clear.The knowledge learnt is useful for physics. Students with m1/2 can handle it easily. Hope you can learn well.Exams are much more difficult than in classes.Students with m1/2 can handle it easily.Hope you can learn well.If you do more extra exercises， you can get good grades.Students with m1/2 can handle it easily.Hope you can learn well.The workload is fair, you can learn better and make less mistakes with those exercise. Students with m1/2 can handle it easily.Hope you can learn well. Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!Add oil!There is really no difference here, for who is your instructor. Lam is already the better one but not much difference is made as the course is really too hard for business students.Just skip the lesson, and go to the tutorials for exercise and the Math support centre for real teaching and advice.Not really easy for those who didn't study M1/M2 in their secondary school.t seemed like professor's main concern was finishing the syllabus, rather than being coherent enough to make sense to students. This is why I stopped going to the lectures and studied from the book on my own.Very basic calculus. People who have studied M2 will find the content easy but the questions in mid-term and final exam can be challenging.The notes of Albert Ku are hand-written and he just pointed out some main formulae and key points instead of giving full explanation. His notes are just basics and not enough for mid-term and exam. When doing revision, better to find some more organised notes.This is a fundamental math course and is compulsory for year-one students, unless you've taken some alike courses before. The content is about basic calculus knowledge.My instructor was from mainland China, and he was energetic and willing to give advice to every individual.As someone who didn't take Math modules in secondary school, I had a difficult time trying to understand the content. The math was quite challenging.

Since attendance was not compulsory, I found it hard to drag myself to a class that I found so boring.

There were:
- online quizzes as HW which you should do well in because they do make a difference in your grade
- midterm
- finalProf Ku was very dull- so much that I only went to lecture once or twice.

Prof Chiang was much better, more dynamic. He would give interesting examples of how the calculus was applied in real life. His passion about Math was very evident and contagious. He also told his personal story about how we sucked at math until uni and he was suddenly top of his game.Basic calculus, mainly on differentiation.
You will find it too easy if you have studied calculus before.
The cotent is useful and rich. teach in details.a nice teacher.good grade,easily get a+.weekly homework.
little and easy.good teacher, content well explain, will answer to students' question patientlyContent is easy. it is all fundamental mathematic theories. for example, the fundamental theory of differentiation.Professor Chow's teaching is absolutely unclear so that i can't even get anything from his course. actually, even i went to all his lectures, i didn't pay attention to his course. it is enough if you only do the practice problems.webwork midterm and final
midterm and final same format
MC and LQThe content is sufficient to understand the basic knowledge.

Review (if there is time available)Professors use quite a number of graphs to illustrate his teaching.Basic M2 stuff.
At the beginning of the course,it includes some knowledge you learned in secondary school like integration.
Basically,most of the year 1 students are required to take this course.Professor Fong is the best professor in my year 1 study.He will provide his own materials and powerpoint and his teaching can cater for all levels of students.Content was not hard. If you attend lectures you will get good grade.
But the meas is high, so you need to score high to get a good grade.
Webwork is comes out evey other weeks.The professor rush through the textbook. My lecturer always sweat a lot.He talks fast and writes fast.No CommentWhen explained, the topics were not too difficult to understand but when faced with questions esp in the midterm and final, it was hard to solve.The lecturer explains the topic elaborately, includes practice questions in class and he likes to walk around the class to see if anyone needs help.Webwork 12%
Midterm 33%
Final 55%

Poor grading because of the curve.Like other math courses, there's webwork almost every week, but it's online-based and allows unlimited trials.
There were past papers to practice for midterm and final which kind of helped when compared to the webwork.the content is related to DSE M2, and some new concept of calculas.(inverse function, )There are 5 chapters on basic calculus, including functions, limits, differentiation, applications of differentiation, and basic integration.Prof Fong's teaching is interesting,sometimes, his response is amazing. but he is no longer to teach Math 1013 in future. he provide his own notes in hard copy each lecture and he do revision before mt and final.I only studied M1 in hkdse and i found this course really hard for me. But if you can manage to do all the webwork by yourself, you won't fail midterm or the final exam. The exam questions are very similar to webwork and past papers. Must do past papers!!!Although I think the professor has a heart in teaching, it was teally hard for me to understand his steps....cannot catch up with his flow. Even TA teaches poorly. You really have to ask for help from senior students or other classmates in order to survive this course.content was okay.
started with numbers, trigonometry, differentiation & the applications, integrals, etc. Lecture notes were pretty good, but you must listen to what prof is saying as well so you get the detailed version.
but I just personally don't like calculus.really bad. Pronunciation is not clear. Make me feel bored all the time. Don't catch anything what prof is saying. I had to sit in other instructor's classes. He teaches just the basic but when it comes to exams. It was super super hard.

Present in class = Absent in class. I didn't learn anything in class, I just spent more time reading the notes and doing exercises outside of the class.simple calculas in your university life which is some basic knowledge you must know,and the content is similar as the textbook in your secondary school , and the course is similar as math1012 but hardersince i have absent too many lesson in fall seem ,so i won't give too much idea about the teaching :PThe content is similar to Dse M2 but more detailed. The topics are related to calculus. There is no attendance requirement and project. People who have studied M2 may find it easy to follow while M1 student will find it more difficult.The teaching is quite good. The professor explains different topics with several examples. The delivery is clear and fluent.TOO HARD for students without previous M2 background since the whole M2 syllabus plus some level-up knowledge are gone through within 3 month lecture. But this course is very advantageous for students who possess previous calculas knowledgeFair. Probably he is just explaining the theories but i guess situation is similar among every lecturerThe content was good. But there were a lot of theorem that I need to rememberHow he delivered the content of this course was not clear at all. And he couldn't handle the class situationThe grading system was a bit harsh for me, because I felt that I only made a small mistake in the calculation but he and the TAs crossed it out and give small marks.The workload was fair enough. And the difficulties of the homework or the tutorial papers were good enough to prepare us for the exams.You need to really focus on the lectures to be able to understand. Of course, you already have the basics of calculus from high school, but trust me, once you see the mid term--it's really different. However, I enjoy learning math so this is actually one of my favorite course lolProfessor is great and is willing to help out each student. After explaining the materials he usually gives a few exercises and looks around the class to make sure that the students are able to do the exercises. His power point is also very clear.There are 5 chapters on basic calculus, including functions, limits, differentiation, applications of differentiation, and basic integration.Teaching materials are taught in an organized and elaborate manner. The professor gave specific lecture notes that helps a lot for the course. He begins each class with a PRS question, which I think helps to make students aware of frequent mistakes. He will also spend time to go through your questions, especially during the paper check so that you know your mistakes.only 40% is in DSE M2, 60% are totally new knowledge. If you study  M1, you need a lot of effort to catch up. Before mid-term is quite simple, but final is really hard.The prof. taught really well, he has some great notes on web page, that will strength your understanding. I will take some time to go through them if I miss the class.Content is overlapping with M2Teaching is rubbish. Unclear explanation, non-m2 student will dunno what the instructor talking about.Really large C range, you will never get a B+ if you fall between -1sd to 1sd, that mean you need to work hard in this course to get a good grade, if you are lazy student, just assume you get a C or less.Only webwork no workload, but the practise for the exam is important, because a lot of sucks will do every year past paper and make your grade very low.the content is quiet easy for those who have studied M2 in the HKDSE. It includes mostly M2 stuffs but more details on theories.Bad. I had attended the first two lessons and then decided to skip all the rest. After a month( before the mid term), i felt scared and decided to attend again. I went once again, and i didn't attend anymore afterward. People who got good grade in HKDSE M2 can skip all lessons.( like myself)Highly duplicative of the M2 syllabus, with only a few new theorems and the "omnipotent" L'Hospital Rule, but otherwise useful and a good revision.A very friendly professor. He always encourages students to try a few problems during his lectures and invite some to present the solutions. He takes rigorous definitions of mathematical terms quite seriously, which is helpful for "clearing concepts". Even so, skipping lectures is suggested because his teaching is best suited for students w/o calculus backgrounds.should be some basic calculus and its compulsory for M1 and M2 students. i think students with weak math basis can ask their friends to teach them or go to math support centermany people skip lessons so its better to have self study. I have attended lessons for the first month but i didn't understand the content so i have self study for the remaining time. i think students with weak math basis can ask their friends to teach them or go to math support center it will be more usefulThis course is quite easy if you have studied m2 before, only a few principles and theorems are to be remembered for MT/final, so picking up should be easy for m2 students while for m1 students, they may feel difficult as they hadn't studied much about topics in 1013 during secondary schools.He will teach a lot of examples in class to demonstrate how to apply different theorems, but I think in general the examples are too easy compared to MT or final, so it really depends on yourself to do the exercises in the book.the notes are not good enough
all copies from book
not many exercises from professor
tutorial is not very usefulteach too slow
last few lessons speed up
tutorial: teach too fast
i have heard that other professors have ppt notes,good explanation
and easier to study and understandNo CommentCalculus. Half DSE-M2 stuff, half new things. Good luck if you are M1.
Here's a list(not complete) of non-M2 stuffs in this course:
Continuity, Differentiability, Intermediate Value Theorem, Mean Value Theorem, 'one-to-one' function, Solving problems with absolute functions, Sandwich(Squeeze) Theorem, Linear Approximation, Newton's Method, Critical Point, Rolle's Theorem, L'Hopital Rule, Reimann Sum, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus(A little more things than DSE M2)Dr. Lam's English is clear, and he is willing to answer student's questions. However, his writes on the whiteboard in a less organised way, so it's not easy to follow. The teaching pace is slow, and he put too much time on explaining the fundamental knowledge that both M1 and M2 and even DSE Maths core should have covered, especially functions... He should have put more efforts on new topics such as L'Hopital Rule and more...

Mr. Kong's tutorial is better, at least he can demonstrate the examples clearly and remind us some important steps/tips in solving problems.

I think attending tutorial is more important than attending lecture. I skip most lectures that teaches M2 stuff.Course descriptionThis is an introductory course in one-variable calculus, the first in the Calculus I and II sequence, designed for students that have taken HKDSE Mathematics Extended Module M1/M2.

We may visit the Math Support Center at Room 3011-3013 for help.No CommentNo CommentCalculus. Half DSE-M2 stuff, half new things. Good luck if you are M1.

Do pastpaper before exam is a must,because questions may be the same . source can be found on peter gao.Not very tough if you finished IB HL Maths. If one is good enough at studying to join HKUST, the content should not be very challenging. However, it is quite tough when it gets to MATH1014.Although the content is not very difficult, the teaching ability of the professor was not very good. Possibly because math concepts are hard to recognize at once due to its nature.A bit different from HKDSE M2
Course Description:
1. functions and graphs
2. limits of functions and continuity
3. derivatives and their applications
4. basic indefinite and definite integrals


Some say that M1 didn't help much.Lessons were absolutely boring.
She only went through notes once on classes without little further explanation. She talked very softly and pronunciation was a bit weird, I could hardly listen.
No attendance recorded
No iPRS
Tutorials were quite useful, and if you have any questions, you may also ask the tutor after class personally.Mainly about secondary syllabus with some extra topics.
Not so easy for those who didnt get a good result in m1/m2 in HKDSELam tsz kin is a good professor as he draws graphs and explains the concept very clearlyAbsoulute grading implying that it is harder to get a better grade if you are not hardworking enoughOnly webwork is required but it can be difficult for those who didn't study well in HKDSE since most of the topics in math 1013 are about secondary calculus. Better revise frequently to understand the conceptBasic DSE M2 Stuff with little new stuff. Easy to understand if you attend the tutorials and read through all the ppt.Explained tonnes of examples during lesson, but not much in teaching solving skills. And also useless notes. Tutorials are good though.Skipped all the lessons, taken DSE M2 before, didn't finish several WebWork. Mid-term and final exmaination >50%. Got a C at the end.Almost weekly WebWork. Everyone have their unique WebWork question but they are similar, you can take reference from your peers' WebWork answer or you can google it. Most of the questions are 'google-able'.if you have studied M2 in secondary school and had got good grade in DSE, you are quite likely to be ensured that you can get at lease B range in math1013.If you are M1 student like me, you should pay more effort on attending the lessons and do more exercises. Don't skip the tutorials when you met a bad lecturer like mine.All in all, I do not recommend Dr Ye as a good choice as her mainland accent is a bit hard to be understood. But she won't count attendance so if you have confidence in your exam performance, just ignore her lectures and do exercises instead.Content

The comtent covers the most important parts of the book. From corporation itself to its investing and financing. The class also includes a tutorial, whose schedule is decided in The first one or two weeks. My schedule totally conflicted with all its tutorials, even the later added one. So I have never been to one. But I think it's ok since the tutorial slides are very easy.


Teaching

Well, what you learnt in class is just NOT ENOUGH! You have no idea what is going to be in the exam! For example, the first part about corporation is covered too little, but it was highly required in the exam!



Grading

10% participation(9% PRS 1% bonus card)
15% homework 9out of 10
30% midterm
45%final
I scored about 87% in total and got a B＋... pretty disappointed. But as I said before, the class is full of experts, so you just can't expect a good grade.

The exam paper seems to be a little bit easier than beforeThis is an introductory course in one-variable calculus, the first in the Calculus I and II sequence, designed for students that have taken HKDSE Mathematics Extended Module M1/M2. Topics include functions and their limits, continuity, derivatives and rules of differentiation, applications of derivatives, and basic integral calculus.
Better than nothingThe content is a bit easy for university level. It covers a lot of high school knowledge.The principles are however very useful.The teaching is simple but easily understandable. The Professor is very nice. The class is very relaxing. In lectures, there is no attendance taken so you can go to the class freely.Simple basic M2 stuff with deeper explanation. It won't be hard if you have studied M2 before.
1. Functions
2. Limit
3. Differentiation
4. Introduction to IntegralFrederick is a funny person. He makes jokes about the politics. Not boring at all.
He has his own notes provided which is easy to read and understand.
Interactive lectures with the use of iPad as "whiteboard" which makes the content easy to understand.Most of them are covered in M2 in DSE. To get good grades, you need to utilise the questions provided in the textbook and most importantly, past papers.Lectures are basically useless and you have to go to tutorials to learn again and get exercises. You will see more question types in tutorial class.Need to compete with science and engineering students, who in general have more mathematical intelligence. Business students can still get good grades if enough effort have been paid.There are online assignments with unlimited trials (not sure if I remembered correctly). Mid-term and final exams could be difficult.The topics were not too difficult to understand as most of it are based on the HKDSE M2 sylllabus if you have studied M2.
The topics are:
limits, differentiation, applications of differentiation, and basic integration.
However, the questions that appear in the midterm and final are not as easy as the webwork or examples on the lecture notes.His English is not fluent enough, but ok for you to understand it. His explanation is very clear, but you may find his teaching a bit slow and the exmples in the lecture notes are too easy.This course is learning what you have learnt in secondary schools.
Excel in high school maths see this course as heaven but other see this course as a purgatory.For Prof.Zhu, despite his accents he is able to explain the concepts in math, and will always encourage us to think and sometime he will call someone to show how to solve the math problem.
For Prof.Ku, his lessons are more boring, and so there were less people attending his course. He is just saying about his notes, ignore his speech and just go through his notes, you will be fine, since his notes are quite good.No Commentwebwork every weekIt covers the basic of calculus. It's not that much different from high school math.The teaching is really good and the pace is just right. However, it can be a bit too slow for those who are good in calculusThe grading is not so good compared to other courses in HKUST.There is not too much workload. There are 9 webworks, 1 midterm and 1 final. However, do not expect the midterm and final to be similar with webworks. In order to get a satisfactory grade, we need to do a lot of exercises.Fundamentals of calculus, review of your highschool Math, but a lot harder.I really like professor Zhu, I think he cares about the student and teaches enthusiasticly.I think the grading for math department is quite hard. Additionally in my class the mean is really high so its quite hard to get a good score. Expect c+ if you only get the mean.webwork every week, not too hard. But its not enough for the exams because the exams are a lot harder. I suggest to practice a lot.The content is simple in the first half part but difficult in the last part.Some students might have learned some parts in high http://school.So I think you may find it easy to follow the pace at first.He is very friendly and always encourages students to do presentation in class to show the solution of math problems.It's either M2 stuff (if you're in HKDSE) or basic math (if you learnt it before) or unknown stuff. I don't have anything else to say really.

PS M2, in full Maths (extended module 2), entails algebra and calculus.A class of 100 or so ended up with only 10 or 20 people coming to class. I am very proud to be one of them who went to almost every lecture... I think that says enough about what other people thinks of the class.

As I took M2 before, I did not find the course extremely difficult.  What I found rather repelling is the instructor's horridly rude reaction when my friend asked him a question - "why don't you go get a M2 book?" WELL, if my friend took M2 before, would she have to ask you? (For that I decline to expose the instructor's name)

There are tutorials as well, but I only went to the first session because the classwork there seems to be quite easy (at least for me). I do recommend you go to the tutorials if you don't seem to get what your instructor said in class.If you get star(s) in DSE M2 like me, you probably don't need to do any extra exercises before midterm. Just revise some examples and do the midterm pastpapers, then it is ok.
However, you need to do extra exercises/tutorials after midterm because nearly everything is new.

I just made serious careless mistake in final, 12 marks (4 MC) is deducted because of my carelessness...

I give "B" because it is just too easy for M2 students but I don't think it is fair for M1 students.
Also, many Non local students have learnt it in their high school, e.g. Function... Not fair for local DSE students.

I think non-local students should go to an advanced class since they have learnt most of the content in high school.He writes his notes on a paper, and uses a visualiser to teach.
Why can't he write on the whiteboard????
I am so disappointed that his handwriting is hardly understandable.

More adversely, his accent is hardly understandable. A lot of people quit his lectures.
I only take his first two lectures and one lecture before midterm. There is no improvement of his teaching.

He will upload the materials he taught in class. I just read it by myself.

Tutors is very very great! Remember to register Leung Ho Ming and sit in the front! I will give him an "A".

But sorry Dr. Hu. I will definitely give him "E".

However, I appreciate his effort since I see him nearly everyday in LG3/LG4 Library and work hard on something, maybe teaching or researching.
Maybe he is a great great researcher, but NOT a good teacher. He is nice to answer your questions, even though you still don't understand what he is talking about (accent)...The content is basically designed for those students who will use calculus just as a tool in their own disciplines. So rigorous maths analyses are not emphasised. In other words, it let you know how to do physics/economics problems and is relatively simple.Dr. Lam can explain points clearly to students, with enough patience. But somehow, his pace is so slow that you may skip some of the classes (as long as you are confident of yourself). No attendance will be recorded towards the final grade.This course covered serval topic, including different type of function, basic limit, derivatives, integration. Most are covered in HKDSE M2.If you good at M2, I would suggest you to study yourself instead of attending the class, unless you want to sleep well. Most of the content are within DSE M2, it is super easy to get good grade if you can learn M2 easily in secondary school.The course material is really easy. I basically learned  everything in this course in my high school.idk... i attended two lectures only.I only attended two lectures in this semester which are the first and  the last lecture.
The miodterm is super easy and the final is much more difficult.
i finally got 90/100 in midterm and 91/100 in final.

Moreover, this course is using absolute grading, which means that as long as you can get overall 85%, you would get into the A range.i barely studied for this course..... what i did is finishing ther past papers before midterm and final.The cotent is useful and rich. teach in details.a nice teacher.good grade,easily get a+.weekly homework.
little and easy.teach in details.a nice teacher.The cotent is useful and rich. teach in details.a nice teacher.good grade,easily get a+.weekly homework.
little and easy.Basic calculus, mainly on differentiation.
You will find it too easy if you have studied calculus before.The accent of the professor is really annoying, although the teaching is alright.
If you have taken M2 or you are good at math, skipping lesson is highly recommended.More calculus, polar coordinates, and some matrices.Skipped lectures, go read online tutorials.The 1014 final was on the 18th of May, 2016. It was also the day of the COMP2711 final.

Needless to say, the 18th of May was Judgement Day.

With each minute that passed in the exam hall, I could see fire rain down from the heavens and smite the poor souls, one by one. Given the conditions of the exam, it is highly unlikely that anyone would pass. I knew for a fact that I would fail. But I didn't.

Why?

There is only one possible explanation.

Ten days after the final exam and a few days before results were released, a divine tradegy occurred.

He died.
Almost noone noticed at first.
Reading the news gave me shivers.
After a while, I felt different.
My soul felt cleansed, my mind clear.
Boys and girls seemed worriless and carefree.

- Merit: Passionate and actively listening. His lecture style is just to use the whiteboard for everything, very wonderful as we can follow how he thinks. His presentation skills in terms of delivering the content is spectacular, everything just links together as lecture approaches the end: you can see him trying to show a theorem many times with various examples as if until you are convinced. Feel free to keep him after lecture for questions and you would see him solving them with you. (Handwritten notes available later online)

- Weakness: His English accent is not particularly good but understandable. His pace of going through concepts and examples in a lecture can be quick and even accelerating, but it is equally satisfying if you manage to follow such a pace; there is often a 5 minute break in the middle :)


Zeta Chan, our tutorial TA, is very practical in solving questions. More like exam-oriented style problem-solving, which is interesting because Prof. Li put it theoretically and you may yet see how you can apply things. A big thumbs-up for his tutorial question set: he stapled and prepared a collection of all-topic questions across the whole semester, just bring that over every time and go to the question he is doing now (answers in a file was released online later). Questions are also highly welcomed; he would walk to you to confirm if you did it right, either by asking or looking at your writing. His English carries the Hong Kong-er accent but you can tell despite this he lays out things intuitively.


TA support in the Math Support Center is sufficient but usually poorly delivered. I don't feel welcomed, but rather kind of a trouble asking obvious questions. Maybe the TAs are already annoyed with meticulous queries of simple questions, and they are systematic enough to put up solutions onto the whiteboard just letting us to refer to it. But regardless of how much we learnt, this is not a learning environment that encourages trying, at least to me.Integration
Integration by parts
Integration by substitution
Integration involving trigonometryAbsolutely bad !!!!£"£%$"£%£"£^&%$£
Extremely difficult to understand what he is saying.
Sometimes English sometimes Putonghua.
Always offtopic in the lesson.
Don't give me time to think about his questions in the lesson.
He teaches you to guess the product to sum formula
"Learning maths is to learn terminology."  [Hu, 2018]
He will bluetick your question.
He will not answer your question directly.
What topics the midterm includes are not clear.
The midterm date is not clear. You will not know unless you ask him.
Server error when doing the midterm online test.If BDSM is your thing, then you'll enjoy this. You get to learn all sorts of ways to torture yourself you didn't even know existed!!! From the light and kinky stuff like volumes of revolution to the hardcore and masochistic stuff like series expansions and partial fractions expansions.

Okay, in all seriousness, it's Calculus 2 for those who follow the US curriculum. You learn integration techniques for the first half then you go on to learning series, sequences etc in the second half. I'm sure it's useful stuff, but still hard none the less.Extremely difficult to understand what he's saying. He has about a 1:1 ratio of filler words to actual words when "teaching". So when he teaches it goes something like this "uhh, so uhhh, today we will ummm, be talking about uhhh integration by errrr parts. To uhhhh integrate........" When I heard that on the first class, I knew that I was in for a very bad time.

Basically non-existent teaching. Instructor blitz through the content like there's no tomorrow. If you go to class, you can only hope to learn something through osmosis, because you'll be furiously taking notes that you'll never read/won't understand or you'll give up half way and just start playing with your phone or flirting with the girl next to you. Which you can then flex your intelligence and show her how much you've self learned.

To rub salt into the wound, you get NDS students who seem to understand everything to the point where they can even correct the instructor's careless mistakes. fml. If they're that good, why even go to class??Mainly about integration, ask you to check divergence/convergence of a series by different test. In the last two week, he taught vector (dot product and cross product).
The math is easy for those who have studied M1 or M2 in high school. The content is mainly about the syllabus of M2.prof lam is a very nice guy. you can ask him question after class.More intergrations, more maths, more vectors, and more approximations.
It is very easy in the first-half, but things will be more difficult afterwards, DSE M2 will help you nothing in this course.
A friend of mine got 3X/100 in midterm, but having 5** in core and M2.
See?The Best lecturer i've met. Coloured notes, clear examples, clear explanations in lectures.
If you still don't understand, find a tutor named Einstein Kong, he is also an excellent tutor, and gives you exercises, and explain as clear as Ho Hon Ming.
Although the tone of the lecturer is monotonous, his notes will explan everything, so some of the people will get the notes and leave.

LOL.Contents were surprisingly interesting. It's okay.He doesn't know how to teach. He doesn't know how to speak English. He doesn't know how to stop saying "uhhhh." He doesn't know how to receive a feedback from pathetic midterm average and reflect it for the finals. If he has at least some sense of guilt, he has to leave this uni and give everyone a refund for the tuition they paid.Integration by parts

IB math HL but worseProbably one of the hardest math courses to take for 1st year students, excluding honors courses of course.

Avery Ching
At this point idk if his teaching is bad or I'm just too dumb. Good that he shows proofs for every formula but the difference in level between exams and lectures/homework is just way too high. He does not explain the concepts that clearly either. Accent is hard to understand and stutters and "uh"s make up 70% of his speech. I recommend to just skip the lectures and attend the tutorials, they are way more helpful.

DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH HIM.

Shixin Liang
REALLYREALLY good TA, explains concepts succinctly and gives lots of good examples. I don't think attendance was counted, but you should still go to her classes, they are very helpful.Moderate difficulty.
This is an introductory course in one-variable calculus, the second in the MATH 1013 – MATH 1014 sequence. Topics include applications of definite integral, improper integrals, vectors, curves and parametric equations, modeling with differential equations, solving simple differential equations, infinite sequences and series, power series and Taylor series.I dont know because I didn't attend the lectures. But the lecture notes and tutorial notes are very detailed, so you can just read the notes and do the exercise and need not to attend classes. Good for those who have a tight schedule.The sequel of MATH1013. The content of 1014 is too much and hard for students who are not good at dealing with Mathematics (Just like ME).

Week 1 Review of definite integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, area between curves, volume by slicing.
Week 2 Volume by cylindrical shells.
Week 3 Work, average value of a function, arc length, area of a surface of revolution.
Week 4 Integration by parts, trigonometric integrals.
Week 5 Trigonometric substitution, polar coordinates and calculus.
Week 6 Partial fractions, summary of integration techniques.
Week 7 Approximation integration, improper integrals.
Week 8 Infinite sequences and series.
Week 9 Integral test, comparison tests, alternating series.
Week 10 Absolute convergence, ratio and root tests, power series.
Week 11 Represention of functions as power series, Taylor and Maclaurin series, applications of Taylor polynomials.
Week 12 Three dimensional coordinate systems, vectors.
Week 13 Dot product and cross product. systems, vectors.I would say Avery's Lectures are boring and not too useful. He just showed the proof of the theorem and demonstrated some simple examples during his lecture but not much for the calculation technique. Attending his lecture is not useful for concrete understanding. His style in the lecture note is unreadable and hard to understand too because there are many mathematical symbols. However, if you are good in Maths and interested in the proof, you may find it helpful.

I advise the "weaker" students to go to tutorial sessions. The concept and skill will be explained well. Tutors are also easier to approach for asking questions. Moreover, the tutorial exercises are abundant for practice.

BTW, The lecture note written by Dr. Ho Hon Ming is a masterpiece. It explains the concept very clearly with diagrams and provides sufficient examples with step-by-step solution. Make sure to get a copy of it.The content mainly focuses on integration and infinite series, and a little bit vector.
Some people may find infinite series difficult, but it will be easier if you spend time understanding itI think Dr. Lam teaches very well, I understand all content through classes, without watching videos on Khan academy.content was a bit difficult for math 1012 students but easy for maths 1013 students. In general, they are affordable.The professor will put his lecture videos in canvas after every lesson. He is patient and nice.  i never attend the tutorial but my friend said the tutorial is much useful than the lecture so i recommend students not to skip any tutorial class.Rich but quite easy. Many calculations and memorizing of formulas. No proving needed.
Comparing to honors course, the content of this course is extremely simplified and shorten,Good but kind of boring. He can elaborate the teaching content but not much of an exciting instructor.
Hadn't gone to class since the midterm.It's the legendary 1014, don't expect that it would be easy

The content is like super hard if you have not studied extended maths, but you would just have to deal with it because it would be required for most of you.The only thing that is good about the course is that he teaches well with his amazing notes.For years and years, this course is rated to be evil. I thought so too. The topics are able to be well-handled before mid-term. All you need to do is to memorize the equations for calculating arc length or trapezoidal rule, midpoint rule etc. However, I found it hard to understand some topics like polar curves and determining the convergent or divergent nature of sequence and series.
(I spent much time on studying both topics from the beginning.)Maybe she is passionate in teaching and topics are well-explained in her notes, you may find it hard to listen to her accent. It is suggested to revise the notes, but not attending the lectures. You will do just fine.Mostly M2 things. Easier to follow if you have learnt M2 in your high school
Not hard to follow or you can even search teaching videos on YouTube

INTEGRATION BY PART

CALCULATING THE VOLUME

VECTORTHE LECTURER JUST FOLLOW THE POWERPOINT TO TEACH. SO IF YOU DONT ATTEND THE LECTURE , YOU CAN JUST STUDY BY YOUR OWN.However, his lecture is quite boring, so some students only take the lecture notes and leaveIntegration of simple functions
- Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration
- Distance travelled by particle
- Future Value and Net Change

(2) Application of Integration
- Volume of solid by revolving around axis/line i.e. Disk/Shell method

- Polar Coordinates and Calculus
- Area bounded by curves and Arc length of curves in Polar Coordinates
- Partial Fractions and Integration
- Estimation for the value of Finite Integration
- Improper Integrals

- Geometric Series
- p-Series
- 8 Convergence Test of Series

(4) Application of Series
- Taylor/Maclaurin polynomials
- Binomial polynomials
- Remainder Theorem of Taylor Series

(5) VectorsThe Professor teach quite well his explain is very clearEven though course's main focus is on integration techniques and series and sequences, it can be quite overwhelming at times because the content is a lot.It seemed like professor's main concern was finishing the syllabus, rather than being coherent enough to make sense to students. This is why I stopped going to the lectures and studied from the book on my own.Keyword Syllabus:

Review of definite integrals and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Velocity and net change, area of a region between curves, volume by slicing and cylindrical shells.
Length of curves, surface area, and work.
Integration by parts, trigonometric integrals, trigonometric substitutions, polar coordinates and calculus, partial fractions.
Numerical integration, improper integrals.
Sequences and infinite series, divergence and integral, ratio, root and comparison tests, alternating series.
Taylor polynomials, power series, and Taylor series.
Vectors in two and three dimensions, dot products, cross products.

Overall, calculus, vector, and series, integrationHHM is ok who always explains in details and provides color lecture notes in each lecture.  He also puts lecture video on canvas. In case you skip lectures, it's still ok to catch up the things.The amount of content is very reasonable for the length of the semester provided that you provide consistent effort throughout. Once you slack, it gets super difficult to catch up and the exam week becomes a nightmare. You need to put a decent amount of effort in solving past papers and tutorial notes because the sums in the exams are similar but a lot more challenging. If conceptual understanding is not attained, forget even about a B.

NOTE: IF ANYONE NEEDS CLEAR SOLUTIONS TO MOST OF THE TUTORIAL NOTES SUMS, FEEL FREE TO HIT ME UP!Avery's lectures were basically lessons on how a simple formula or relationship was derived which is completely useless when it comes to doing well in exams. He will direct questions to the students and end up answering them himself almost immediately lol. He has a very thick accent which gets a few weeks at least to get accustomed to and by the time you do, you realize half of the semester has gone by and you have better things to do than decipher the lecturer's accent and that's when you start running to the MSC, desperate for help that you don't even seem to know where.

On the other hand, Phyllis is an excellent TA. The way she will explain concepts to you are exemplary. She will ingrain them in your mind and make sure you understand fully before moving on. However, she has a slight accent problem but it is way easier to comprehend than Avery's.

All in all, I'd recommend skipping the lectures but following the tutorials religiously.Only covered part of the DSE syllabus, that means you have to learn a lot.She will just fill in the blank of her notes, with mainland accent. However, her hand writing is beautiful.Absolute grading which mean it is quite suck for the grade. if you just have a bear pass, the grade most likely will be C-.Webwork 15%
mid term 35%
final 50%
with extra bonus quiz 8%
remember to do the quiz, this can most likely help you up a 2 sub grade if you get correctly.
Also you can use web math calculator, just dun let the ta to see that.If BDSM is your thing, then you'll enjoy this.

Week 13 Dot product and cross product. systems, vectors.At the beginning, I do not really get what professor is saying. Just blindly copying down everything and digests the things I write in my note. For the first half of the course, it is mainly about integration which some of the contents have been taught in high school. Even though it is not that difficult compared to the second half of the course, it still needs some hard work in order to score well in mid term exam. For the second half of the course, I would say, TORTURING and SUFFERING. As an A level graduate, I have never been taught Sequence and Series. It needs a lot and a lot of practices if you want to survive through it.Actually hard , lessons are boring .You can study yourself at home by doing a lot of exercise.Tutorial class is much more important than lecture.Useful for further study for math2023
At the beginning of the course , so http://easy.At the end of the course , (taylor series) not hard but not simpleSo many prove on the lessons. I did not attend any lesson for math1013 , because so boring and so many proveActually, the course covers some basic stuff that you have learnt in your high school (M1 and M2), new stuff including series and sequences.Totally bad, it makes no difference if you don't attend any of the lectures. He copied everything in the notes that would be uploaded in his website, and he focuses on how to proof the theorems but in the 1000-levels, mostly students are required to solve the answer but not to prove.
In the meantime, the TA is outstanding. What she taught is completely differs from the prof. Teaching how to use theorems in practical examples and willing to answer any problems in the MSE. So would recommend you to attend the tutorials.Mainly about Calculus and Series. Focusing more on Calculus in the first half of the semester, and then series on the following semester. No attendance would be taken may be good for those self-learner.Not as good as those reviews said, maybe Professor is good at consolidate our concepts but his lecture is quite boring.Lots of modules will be taught and most of them are difficult for students to understand.The lecturer did not explain enough, she just gives many examples and steps to solve it but it is very hard to understand if you do not know the basic.

Tutorial is better as the tutor explain detailly which is a must-attend lesson if you want to get a good gradeApplications of definite integrals, integration techniques, improper integrals, infinite sequences and infinite series, power series and Taylor series, and vectors.

The later parts focus less on the application but the proof. As long as you do some exercise and find the trick for proofs (which are pretty standard). It is not hard to perform well in the exam.He provides lecture videos which may be useful during your exam review. The most important thing to do is to finish the end of chapter exercise in the book which can be found online.Basic Integration, Application of integration, sequence, series, convergence and divergence, Taylor series, vector ...Proof omitted. To get a better understanding of the subject, I suggest borrowing a book from the library.There will be bonus quizzes which count up to 8% of your final grade. If you perform badly in exams, don't worry you still have a chance.

Overall, the difficulty is moderate.weekly webwork only. However, if you want to get a good grade, you should do the exercises provided in a website that the instructor will send to you.About integration(different integration technique such as by-parts and  Trigonometry substitution), sequence and series(different types of infinite series and how to prove it is convergent or divergent), and vector(dot product and cross product)Explain concepts clearly and solve questions step by step. Provide notes with full color for students. Speak fluent and clear English, everyone can understand his teaching.rich content, 39 chapters in total, therefore the pace of teaching was fast and quite hard to catch up. The content includes basics differentiation and integration techniques, and applications.Lam's teaching was quite good and friendly, but the style of summer course was like self-learning. You have to finish a set of class work and quiz every lesson.a bit more difficult than math1013

applications of definite integral, improper integrals, vectors, curves and parametric equations, infinite sequences and series, power series and Taylor series.

difficulty of topics related to applications of definite integral are similar as math1013
vectors are basic m2 stuff (cross, dot product and some applications)
topics related to sequences and series are more difficultcompletely different from how others describe him, very good instructor

provide colourful notes each lecture

very clear explanation in every example (including every important step) and may use some creative examples to explain some conceptsIntegration
Volume of revolution, area, integration by part, Trigonometric integrals , substitution, Polar coordinate, sequences, integral test, VectorSecond part of MATH1013 which I think is (of course) harder than 1013.

Useful content for engineering students but might be a bit boring for students who are into statistics and probabilities.Personally, i think that Ho Hon Ming is the best Math prof in HKUST. He explains in a clear tone and slow but sure. He always hands out this color printed note every lecture, so make sure that you always attend the lecture on time because some students from other lectures would come in just to take the notes. He gave us more example exercises online which greatly helped me to study for the midterm. He also posted his lecture videos online, so don't worry about getting late or skipping morning lectures.The topics covered were not so complicated but in exam the difficulty was far beyond you could imagine.

Taylor series, divergence tests are of the utmost importance among all the topics included in the course so spend more time on it.The materials given by Mr.Ho were so good. But do attend lectures if you wanna get a copy.bad course

By the way, this course is quite easy for people who are good in M2 for HKDSE studetns. Good Luck.Ho Hon Ming is quite good for teaching students who  takes relatively longer time to understand the logic of the mathematics and topics. He gradually teach the concepts from easy examples to difficult examples.  For the elite, they wont like his teaching method because it will be too slow for them.Mainly integration
seriesNot Lecture and need self-study.
It had a sheet of notes with no example.B-
As it is absolute grading , it is easier to get high grade than before.
40% pass and over 85% will get a range.Not more graded by the curve .Every lesson had quiz and homework.
It needed to study before each lesson .
Each Homework had time limited.
Plus,It only had  a sheet of paper that prepared from TA . So , student may need to find more examples to do . Or ask for each questionsgo to classviaThe contents might be basic calculus, which is useful in later studies.The instructor just read his notes and might make some small mistakes in class. However, his notes are quite useful and well-written.This course uses absolute grading, which makes some students not satisfied with the instructor. Some students even complain that most students are not able to pass this course. In fact, The instructor realized this and open some pop-up quizzes so that students can get some extra scores. These quizzes are similar to the examples and the homework, so I think students can get some score from these quizzes easily if they have studied the sample quizzes. The final exam is easier than the midterm exam. Maybe the instructor worried about failing too many students.There are several webworks to do during the semester. Some of them are really difficult, which need you to work very hard on it. Really need to spend a lot of time if you want to get a good grade.We had learnt much more than in 1013.
After sequence it become difficult and we need to remember some staff but overall it is easy.
Not much proving problems.
Most of the problems are solved by calculation.Professor Ye is very dedicated and patient.Content is mainly about integration:
Area, volume, some estimation
the most interesting part is series
last chapter is about vector
Most of them are just DSE stuffLam Tsz Kin is good, he uses a wide range of examples to explain some concepts in calculus
A kind prof, always answer questions to the studentsIt is more difficult than MATH 1013. However, if you have taken M2 in your secondary school, it is easier for you, especially calculating the volume, Integration by parts, Trigonometric integrals, Trigonometric substitution, and vector.

Content above put with asterisk are in M2 syllabus.Dr Ho teaches by 3 screens. He writes down what he says while teaching, so you must know what he is talking about and you can follow the progress. He will repeat the important point once. The notes written in the lecture actually come from the the notes you got, but you should still attend his lecture, you will understand it better. At the end of each lectures, he will ask all students whether they have questions, I have never seen that there was students raising questions at that moment. However, if you really have questions, you can and you should ask him after the lectures. He is willing to answer you. You will feel his solemn attitude in the lecture and I also noticed his smile once only in the lecture (same as one of the previous reviewer). However, you will notice his sincere smile more if you ask him questions sincerely.

Two reminders :
You need to attend his lectures to get the lecture notes. There are lecture videos on Canvas.1. Integration(Integration techniques, arc length, volume, surface area, physical applications, indefinite and definite integrations, improper integrals, integration in polar coordinates...)
2. Sequences and infinite series(Convergence of sequences, infinite sums, convergence/divergence tests on infinite series, power series, taylor polynomials, taylor series...)
3. Vectors(All M2 stuffs)

Not a lot of DSE M2 things. Topics in sequences and series are quite hard, please study hard on it and don't be like me.(Note: I am not enrolled into Dr. Ho's section but I sit his lessons for the whole semester)
His teaching is super clear though a bit fast, and he explain the examples/concepts very thoroughly. His colored notes are very useful in revision.The content may be a bit too much for some students, because it covers about 5 chapters in totalWell explained. The lecture notes he provided before each lecture are really useful for our learning.For the first time in a while, Dr. Lam (course coordinator) sets an absolute grading scheme instead of relative grading, but the grading may be bad for a majority of students (about C range). Quite beneficial for people really good at this course.We do not need too much time dealing with webworks (if you attend the lecture seriously), but that itself is not sufficient for learning. Gotta have to do lots of revisions to be able to get good results.The course uses the same textbook for MATH 1013.

The integration and vector part are just the same as the M2 calculus in HKDSE. The most difficult part should be the infinite sequences and series because there are many concepts and theorem involved. Therefore, I spent most of the time in studying this part.His notes are well prepared and clearly explained the equation, however, you have to attend his lecture in order to get his notes because there are no electronic copies in canvas. There are also lecture videos provided.

Revision exercises will also be uploaded in the canvas and they are quite similar with the midterm and final exam. So, it is better to study them as well.Area between curves

Personally, I think polar coordinates and series are complicated. More time is required for revising these topics.I didn't attend her lectures as her teaching is not very good. Instead, I attended another tutor's lectures.
There are tutorials for the course, but many of the people simply skip them.Chapter 6: Section 6.1 - 6.5 (Applications of Integration);   Chapter 8: Section 8.1 - 8.2 (Arc length and Surface Area)

(Textbook: J. Stewart, Calculus Early Transcendentals, 7th ed.)In my opinion, he is one of the best lecturers in the Math department. He will provide coloured notes with clear examples and clear explanations in lectures.all topics:

They are not difficult if you attend all the classes.
Content is fair for a 3 cred course
MSC can help you a lot for anything you feel confusedHe is greatness, and the best teacher to get a good grade.Most people will think it is hard. Personally I think so too because I did not work hard and only study the materials just before exam. If you study the materials weekly or even daily, you should be ok.great teacher. Very clear on very steps. He prepared notes for you but you need to attend lectures. His notes is also very clear and is color printed.Heavy content
Integration and Application
Sequence and Series
VectorsThe lecturer is very bad as she didn't explain everything to the students.
Better to read the notes and do exercises by yourself.Not good.
Both mean of the midterm and final exam is around 35. And the standard deviations of are very large, which are greater than 20.
I got nearly above mean 1 SD in the midterm and 0.5 SD in the final exam. I can just get a B only.11 webworks
4 quizzes
1 midterm
1 final
The quizzes are to be done in Math Learning Center, which is totally different from the webworks.Nothing special, following the Calculus textbook chapter by chapter. The textbook is not required as the professor upload slides, which is enough for study.The professor has a really strong mainland accent and sometimes the teaching can't be heard clearly (well, maybe only I have this problem...). The teaching of the professor is acceptable, but sometimes she will use up all the whiteboard to prove some minor theories, going nowhere.M2 calculus~e.g. Area between curves , Volumes , Volumes by cylindrical shells,Area of a surface of revolution , Integration by parts,Trigonometric integrals , Trigonometric substitution ,  Polar coordinates , Polar coordinates areas and lengths,Sequences , Infinite series ,Integral test , Comparison test, Alternating series
Finally,
Absolute convergence, ratio and root tests (11.6), Strategy (11.7), Power series  are most important in examso boring
Skipped lectures, go watch online tutorials, e.g. MIT youtube.Calculus based content with a little bit of basic vectors at the end.A lot of practice is required and there are many concepts to learn. Understanding the concepts is very important so an aptitude for math is required.Teaching is decent, but the course is more about self study and grasping various concepts. Can approach support centre to clear any doubts related to course content.More integration techniques
Disk / Shell revolution methods to find volume
Polar Coordinates
Series / Sequences
Simple VectorsThe teaching was quite interesting and was easy enough to understand as the professor was quite experienced.

Helpful instructor.
The professors office is in the math support center and is easy to find.pre midterm- basically all the calculus you have learned in you high school, with some additional integration methods like shell method, disk method, arc length, surface area and numerical integration and polar coordinate.

Post midterm- sequence, infinite series, taylor and maclaurin series, binomial functionVery bad teaching. Didn't attend a single lecture after midterm because it is a waste of time. Although she wouldn't just read off the powerpoint during her lecture, it is very hard to follow her ppt because it contains too much information and words to follow. Self study better.Basically the content are listed below...
Application of integration
Technique of integration
Polar Coordinates
Sequence
Series
Vectors

Midterm and Exam Question were "classical" that you have to hand-calculate numbers that have to calculate by calculators.just go to learn the contents in youtube.

Go attend tutorials might help.It talks about sequence and series which are quite rare for DSE students and for DSE M2 students, they should be ok for the parts of calculus.
Topics are quite related but many of them are just briefly discussed.The main reason why I don't go to the lectures is because professor's main concern was just finishing the syllabus without really explaining all the abstract concepts.Mostly M2 things. Easier to follow if you have learnt M2 in your high school
Not hard to follow or you can even search teaching videos on YouTubeAll I can say is that it is totally fine to get a pass even you only learn from video on YouTube.Mainly the syllabus of M2. IF you did not study M1/2 before, actually you can catch it up by hard working. I think is not that hard if u really pay attentionit is good I did not study a lot I still got an B.it is harder than math1013 so you have to give more time to study this course. Only webwork and I think is better to attend all tutorials because it really give u chance practicingThis course is a sequel to Math1012 or Math1013. Topics include applications of definite integrals, integration techniques, improper integrals, infinite sequences and infinite series, power series and Taylor series, and vectors.Lectures are boring although the Professor has heart to teach.Some topic is studied in dse M2, e.g. intergration, vector.His notes are well prepared and clearly explained the equation. However, his lecture is quite boring, so some students only take the lecture notes and leaveThe grading:
12%webwork as hw (almost everyone gets full marks)

33% mid-term (mean: 61/100 SD:23)

45% final (mean:51/100 SD:22)

5%bonus quiz ( total 4 quizes)The workload is not heavy, webwork, mid-term and final. with the bonus quiz. The final exam is a lot difficult than the webwork, so don't just study the question on the webwork.Basically, you can divide the course into four parts.
Before mid-term:
Part 1: Application of Integration
Integration techniques
Improper integrals
If you have studied M2 in secondary school, the first part about integration is manageable.

Part 2: Polar coordinates

After midterm:
Part 3: Sequences and Series
This is the part where it gets complicated and confusing, so be aware.

Part 4: 3D vector
Again, part 4 is just secondary school stuffs.Teaching is quite good. He makes very detailed step by step calculations. Prefer not to skip those lectures for no reason as notes are provided at the lecture.His ppt slides are very clear and almost cover all the details. The content is a bit easy and what he taught is just the example on the ppt slides.When he is explaining the examples, he says very specific and tell the students the key point. And additional examples he won't waste more time and just let students to review after the course.Application of Integration(area ,volume,arc length,surface area,)
Integration techniques (by part ,trigonometric substition, partial fraction, numerical integration)
Improper integrals
Sequence and series
Power series and Taylor series
Vectors
It starts easy in the beginning but gets quite difficult towards to end.His teaching method is very elaborative and clearly shows his way of tackling a problem with his thinking methodology and the steps that follow. All of this is accompanied by his own personalized notes that are also very detailed with plenty of examples to go through for each topic.Content was interesting - just further covering about integrals and its application.He is very good at explaining the concept and allow us to understand them very well. Sometimes he is really funny (unintentionally).Grading so bad and very high SD. I worked so hard but bad grade.Not too much workload I guess since there is only midterm, final and online assignment. Even though during the semester you may feel there aren't much to do, there are so many things to study for the midterm and final.advanced math1013 more about sequence and testing whether it is infinite or not, actually not that difficult(it is important to understand all Webwork)
A lot of test for them, confusing me at the beginning(better to be able distinguish them as soon as possible, don't keep mixing them up in study break)Nice instructor, attractive hair style ^_^  , if you(a local) find him after class for asking questions, he will explain it in Cantonese, gd gdWhat the course covered:
1. Integration technique,
included : Direct integration, substitution method, trigonometric integration and substitution, partial fraction, integration by parts, application of integration

2. Sequences and Series
3. Introduction to 3D vectors

The hard part for me is about sequences and series. So better be careful on that partI like Dr. Ho's teaching as he prepared his own colored notes and his handwriting is very nice and tidy. But for me the pace of his lectures were quite slow as he sometimes explained the things explained before.

The tutorials themselves were useful as the tutor gave us many review questions that can be used to prepare for the examThe contents are integration, vectors, approxiamtions etc.
It is easy at the begining and become quite difficult afterwards. The content in the midterm and  final is much more difficult.HO Hon Ming teaching is quite good as he list the steps and thinking procedures clearly in his lecture notes.Application of Integration(area ,volume,arc length,surface area,)
Integration technique (by part ,trigonometric substition, partial fraction, numerical integration)
Improper integral
Sequence and series
Power series and talyor series
VectorHO HON MING is quite good with his teaching and well elaborate of the concept. The worst thing is that you need to attend in class in order to get his notes.
Einstein is a good ta. He explain the qestion very well and provide us many exercise.Basically, this course is a sequel of MATH1013. Containing more in-depth calculus, it is surely harder to handle. The scope is quite broad in my opinion, covering more difficult integration techniques, sequence, convergence and divergence, Taylor & Maclaurin Series, vector manipulation...I think it is way more than what a 3-credit course is expected to introduce.Daniel's teaching is not bad anyway. Perhaps it is because of the venue (LT-C), if you are late for the lecture, you gotta sit at the back and prepare for not being able to see any contents from the whiteboard. The Prof's delivery could be often tedious that provokes you to leave early.Mostly repeating what students have learnt in senior high school. Though it may seems useful, it only scratch the surface of materials and will not be that useful for the higher level courses.Very boring teaching style. Though he gives a lot of examples.Covers basic skills and knowledge for further study. But there are no proofs for some conclusion.Good elaborations and detailed notes. The notes are really useful. The instructor is also very responsible and patient. But the way he gave his lecture is a little boring.Extremely difficult course with a lot of topics coveredcourse was well taught and explained by the instructor.  Dr HO makes the topics somewhat understandable.  Coloured notes are provided which have plenty of examples with explanations.

Tutorials were usefulThis course is called one of the most difficult courses in HKUST and I agree. The content, till the midterm, is difficult but manageable. However, after the midterm, the content slowly and steadily becomes so incredibly tough that by the time the finals are around the corner, the syllabus looks like Mt. Everest.Ho Hon Ming is a good professor, who is very systematic and his notes are easily the best notes available. In fact, if the content would have been easier, I think anyone can understand the concepts by attending his classes.integration
polar coordinates
improper integrals
vectors
series and Taylor series
much harder than DSE M2 materialsThe teacher spoke too quickly and it was hard to catch up.  Sometimes he got confused and taught wrong stuffs.  He gave many examples.  Can just go to MSC to ask the staff when you encounter problems.This course continue from the MATH1013, starting with integration. The method of integration is mostly the same as of HKDSE M2. However, partial fraction was not included in my DSE education, which is included in this course. (But some other students said that this was taught also in M2)
The application of integration is more difficult than HKDSE M2. After that, sequence and series are also being taught. This might be quite difficult for M2 students so don't think this course is as easy as MATH1013. The content can be said to be less than  what a 3 credit course should be, but it is not as simple as MATH1013.Professor Chow is more like a tutor than a lecturer. Though he would talk about some theory, but he will be more based on applications and examples. The lecture notes are excellent and his class is better than Ho Hon Ming. Don't understand why he is less popular but I think it is quite fun to attend his class.
Dave Au is an excellent tutor. He would try his best to answer student's question.It is part II of single-variable calculus.  The difficultiy is moderate.
Topics include applications of definite integral, improper integrals, vectors, solving simple differential equations, infinite sequences and series, power series and Taylor series.Poor teaching method and style.  I simply skip all the lesson.More advanced after mid term.
If you got M2 in DSE，then you dont need to worry before mid term but you really need to give efforts after mid term because the knowledge in DSE cant help you in advanced integration.He is amazing teacher. Clear explanation and wonderful notes.
He will only have the notes in hardcopy and if you miss some of his lessons, you can ask him to see is there any copy left or ask him to print for you.
Very helpful notes in examThis knowledge will learn in this course are seldom used in later course unless you are major in maths.  Also the lecture notes is quite useless.The lecturer always make some new question in the lesson but he can not calculate the answer . You better learn in for the youtube videopoor grade, you can only get c grade if your mark is not higher than 70% of the total mark. It is quite difficult for student who only studied Math1012 and student who study Math1012 usually get c grade in this courseWebwork every weekThe content is basically the m2 maths. For the student like me has the m1 background will be a little bit difficult to follow.The teacher will do a review on the midterm and final exam. He also gave us some tips and explain the most important content again.the grading is an absolute grading so my grade is not very good even I am above mean. I cannotThe workload is quite high. you will have assignment almost every week. there are around 10 questions in each assignment. you will have a week to finish them.Volume of Revolution (simply using the formulas)
Polar coordinates (very brief)
Integration Technique
Sequences and Series
Alternating Series
Vectors (easy M2 level)

I certainly recommend students who may want to improve their poor mathematical mindset to try to read some more textbooks to ensure you can understand and get hold of the knowledge.To be honest, I think his accent is difficult to comprehend if you do not read the textbook before class. During class, you mainly study the proof and orientation about the mathematical theory and formulas, which is seemingly useless regarding those quiz and exam questions for this course. I cannot deny the logic and mathematical induction is important, especially for long-term learning and in-depth study later, but such value is not significant during the exams. The TA is helpful and nice but sometimes emotional, but overall is outstanding. Make sure you seek help from the TA whenever you need help!It is fundamental course. It is a easy course for a university student. If you have taken M2 in DSE, it will be easy for you.A little bit boring. But he explain the theorem very clearly, and it is better for you to ask her some questions after the lecture.
And the tutorial is good cuz it will distribute some questions to you.-Applications of integration (including area of region, volume, physical application...)
-Arc length and surface area
-Integration techniques (method of substitutions, integration by parts, trigonometric integrals, trigonometric substitutions, partial fractions)
-Polar coordinates and calculus
-Numerical integration
-Improper integrals
-Infinite sequences and series, power series
-Vectors, dot product, cross product

Even the content is quite interesting and useful for future study, as a student who isn't good at math and without DSE M1/M2 background (from MATH 1012), the content is quite difficult for me...But it isn't really a problem if you learn the stuffs step by step.Dr. Ho is a very good lecturer.
He teaches well, in an organized way. He explains thing with a clear logical flow and writes the examples/calculation/steps neatly. His teaching is effective.

One thing that must be mentioned is his incredible colour printed notes.
-Clear
-Concise
-Well-organized
-Adequate
(also, the notes look nice which can boost your studying morale)Integration, Volume of revolution, area, integration by part, Trigonometric integrals , substitution, Polar coordinate, sequences, integral test, VectorOnly some class have notes but you won't think them because they are useless. I suggest you study this course by yourself from the ebook which is useful.Online Homework (WeBWorK): 12%

Must do bonus quiz!!Except webwork and five bonus quiz, this course don't have any other homework. However, if you want to get better result in mid-term and final, you have to study quite hard in order to get into B range.If you have studied M2 in high school or do well in Math1013, it is not difficult, before the midterm. After the midterm, the topics become more difficult, you should clarify the concepts otherwise you will write noting in an exam paper.Ho Hon Ming has aroused my interest in math again, he brings back my life, he gives me confidence, and he gives me the determination to strive for excellence.
Now I do practices every day and I find it fun.Content taught basic techniques of Calculus.
It s especially useful if you are interest in Graphic ResearchGood teaching,explain clearly about the concept.
You 're especially need to read the extra reading as Jun suggested.
It 's also suggested you goto MATH1024 lesson for sit the lesson and know what 's going on about the Mathematics and its related theory.
MATH1024 is more conscious and logic is more deeper than MATH1014.It's a consecutive math course of MATH1013. The content of this course mainly include 5 general topics:

(1) Basic Knowledge of Integration
Substantial content is included in M2.
- Integration of simple functions
- Integration by Substitution
- Integration by Parts
- Trigonometry + Integration

New Concept:
- Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration
- Distance travelled by particle
- Future Value and Net Change

(2) Application of Integration
Half of the content is covered by M2, but the exam question can be extremely difficult without using calculator.
- Area between curves
- Volume of solid by revolving around axis/line i.e. Disk/Shell method

New concepts:
- Slicing Method
- Arc Length of a curve
- Surface Area of the solid generated by revolving around axis

(4) Application of Series
- Taylor/Maclaurin polynomials
- Binomial polynomials
- Remainder Theorem of Taylor Series

(5) Vectors
All concepts are covered by M2.

Personally, I think the most difficult part of the course is Work and Comparison Test.I skipped all lessons and tutorials.

I studied hard on half of all lecture notes on Canvas, especially Work, Sequence and Series.

Notes of Professor Zhang are treasures. If you deliberately revise on all the notes, you should obtain a clear concept.

Remember that all proves will not be examined.calculuskiller instructor, i skiped the last few week lecture coz dunno wt he was talking about , i just read the textbook myself ,

killer instructor,he taught the new topic in the last lesson before midterm and  final , but the topics were covered in the midterm or examThis course is difficult for student without math background. If you do not have any math background, you have to work hard on this courseOverall good. You have to attend the course as Prof. Lam love to write all his teachings on board. You need to pay attention in class and jot notes during lesson.Grading is suck. This course is very easy to pass, but difficult to obtain a good grade. You have to work very hard to get a better grade.Webwork is fair. If you treat it seriously, webwork would be a great help.easyThe math is really hard especially for those who have not studied M1 or M2 in high schoolThe TAs are very unhelpful
But the instructor is good in presenting and teaching the math concepts, making them easier to understandVery hard to get good grade
Even though there are quizzes that give you extra marks, but they don't really help in lifting the gradesWorkload is fine I guess
About 1 webwork per week
and 4 quizzes to for the whole course but the quizzes are not compulsoryLots of content. Final exam require all the content at this term.TKLam teaching is good and understandable. He is willing to answer questions too.I am not really sure about that. It seems that 95up with bonus no A+. Nothing to say at all.
Grading includes mainly in final exam, some on midterm with a basic score that very easy to get full mark that are the webwork exercise and those bonus quzi. Those bonus quzi, good to do the sample, they are simular.Lots of practice but no A+.The course content consists of two parts: linear algebra and ode. Calculation by computer program (GNU Octave) is also included. [this year final consists of some questions on it but not many of us study so deep.. it's a trap.. remember to study]

As a Civil engineering students, I need to enroll (sigh), CENG also too.
Actually the content is too much to a 3 cred course
Some content are not difficult (eg prove linear dependent/ independent) and you need to study more and you will be find
BUT some are too confusing/ complex.. eg in the exam, the question asks you to find a suitable substitution but actually normal students cant think of (wtf!)
and I believe not many students can get all concepts and ways even after final examThe course mainly covers two parts, including linear algebra and ordinary differential equation (ODE).  Calculation by computer programme (GNU Octave) is also included.

According to the plan of the instructor, linear algebra is taught in the first half of the semester, while the second half of the semester is used to introduce the ODE calculation.

In my opnion, this syllabus of the course is too wide, and it seems to squeeze the material of two courses into one course.  
As a result, the instructor used about 3/4 of the semester to teach linear algebra, while only about 3 to 4 weeks to teach ODE.  I found it hard to follow such a lot of material in a short time.

On the other hand, the computer programme part (GNU octave) of the course is not adquate, because the instructor just do few dememonstrations in lessons, without fully explain the function of the commands.  As a result, this part is also hard to follow, and there are difficulties for us to use the techniques of the programme taught in the course in the future.There are lecture notes for each chapter of the course, which is highly informative (150 slides in average).  In other words, there are lots of proves which are not useful are put in the notes.

Due to the lack of time, the instructor ususally skip notes, so it is hard for me to catch up, and know which part is important in the lecture notes of 150 slides.

As a result, I need to revise at home by myself in order to tackle the examination.
Note that the instructor is kind and willing to answer our question.

The instructor has uploaded a set of notes about matlab (computer programme), however, he didn't use the notes much, and I need to spend time to read it by myself.

About the tutorial, Ms. Zhang, luchan has done a great job, because she taught the material exceptionally clear, and whe is willing to answer question patiently that we raised in class.  She will also reply email quickly if we ask question by sending email.This course consists of two parts: linear algebra and ode. Towards the end of the course, you will learn solving systems of ode, which is a mix of two parts. You only need to memorize the computations and neglect the proof for the midterm and final exam. A few multiple choice questions in both midterm and final are about octave commands, so you should at least have a look at them.Completely rubbish. Don't attend the lectures because it will be a mere waste of time. The lecture notes are also useless. For the linear algebra part, revise Dr Wong's MATH2011 notes instead. For the ODE part, good luck.Lecture notes, ppt, tutorial materials are basically useless. Some difficult theorems are presented in only one page, proofs are often omitted.Sure that Lee wing lung doesnt know how to teach, he's been into the wrong profession. Seriously, he even doesnt understand the content. It's not your loss not to attend his class.The course is divided into two parts.
The first part is mainly composed of basic DSE complex number, M2 matrix knowledge, 4x4 determinant, eigenvalue, eigenvector and LU decomposition, which will be tested only in the midterm.
The second part is mainly composed of differential equations including first and second-ode differential equations, which will be tested in the final exam. They are not so difficult if you remember some basic formulas.Chasnov has an interesting accent but he explains well on the topics. Though I started skipping lessons after midterm, I did just fine on the final exam. He also gave us tips on midterm and final exam. A practice was given before the midterm and the midterm had roughly the same style as the practice. Eventually I got full mark on midterm. I love Xu Wei as my tutor as he teaches great and speaks Cantonese. (and handsome as well)The course is divided into two parts, the first on is about matrix (until midterm) and the second is about differential equations (after midterm). Matrix is relatively easier compared to the differential equations. For the ODE, you need to memorise steps of each case. i.e. which step should you use for homogenous and inhomogeneous, etc.In my opinion, I like his teaching style. Although some may find his pace quite fast, but for me the pace was just right. He seemed to be more passionate about ODEs than matrix.

The midterm questions were really similar to the practice exercise he gave. But there were no exercises for finals, although he gave A LOT of hints, tips and tricks at the last lecture meeting. So it is important to attend the last if you don't normally go to his lectures. Lecture videos were also available.Ch 0 A short mathematical review

Part I Linear algebra
Ch 1 The language of linear algebra
Ch 2 Matrices

Complex number is involved in solving odes with complex distinct roots.

If you are local student studying M2 before, then Ch 2-4 are piece of cake to you, but there are still some new topics and concepts in the linear algebra part such as vector space, subspace, inner product, outer product, trace of square matrix, rotation matrix, orthogonal matrix, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.Prof. CHASNOV teaches by following the lecture notes. I personally think that his teaching pace is quite fast and I cannot catch up in his lectures (especially in the differential equations part). If you cannot catch up, it is better to study the lecture notes after the lecture though it is quite clumsy and involves many words.

Instead of using Canvas, professor designs a web page for this course. All useful materials are in there. Lecture videos are provided.This course teach basics of linear algebra and differential equation.
The content include:
-Linear system and matrix algebra
-Vector spaces and inner product spaces
-Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
-First order and homogeneous second order ODEs
-System of first order linear ODEs

This course didn't go deep with each topics, only teach the basic concepts and some simple problems.The Professor basically just read the PPT and I cannot really learn anything from his lecture. The manner he teach is not quit suitable for people without solid Math background.
He did some examples at the end of lectures in a very fast way that I cannot learn anything at all.Pre-Registered for Civil Engineering students, and the course included the materials in MATH 2111(Matrix) and MATH 2351(Differential Equation), in addition, Octave is also included. (Octave can help you to calculate matrix, plot diagram and solve equations)Poor PPTs and presentation, even though you attended the lesson, you probably can't understand what the instructor taught.
The only knowledge you can get from the lesson would be the operation of Octave and able to copy his examples written on the whiteboard (that is not included in the PPT).

For tutorials, it depends on which class do you attend, some of them are quite good. My TA is good and trying to explain most of the questions in the tutorial notes. Even though he can't finish all the question, he will upload the steps and answer for us.This course is about matrices and ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

Matrices contains basic matrix calculations, vector spaces, subspace, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

ODEs just contains the fundamental parts but they are hard enough for students.

The notes are horrible, difficult proofs of theory fill the pages of the notes which is useless for engineering students . I think the proofs should not be taught in intro course, it should appear in math major courses.

And Octave commands are tested in three quizzes (1% each) but I strongly disagree it is asked in exams.Lee Wing Lung is obvious the worst teacher ever. He doesn't know teaching and spends a lot of time to play Octave (mathematical software) with his computer. I usually fell asleep when he did that. I learned most of the content  from tutorials by Xu Wei, a very nice tutor who can speak cantonese.This course are divided into 2 major parts:
1. Applied Linear Algebra (MATH2111)
2. Ordinary Differential Equation (MATH2350)

Intended Learning Objectives :
1 Manipulate systematically a system of linear equations.
2 Manipulate the basic algebra and computation techniques of matrices and determinants, and invoke MATLAB (or substitutes) to help the computations.
3 Describe the basic terminologies appeared in vector spaces and inner product spaces.
4 Formulate the concept and properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, and operate the diagonalization process and recognize the applications.
5 Describe the solutions of simple first order ODEs analytically, and graphically with the help of MATLAB (or substitutes).
6 Comprehend the solution behaviors of second order linear ODEs with constant coefficients, and recognize their roles in free and forced oscillations.
7 Describe the solutions of a homogeneous system of first order ODEs with constant coefficients analytically, and numerically with the help of MATLAB (or substitutes).

But I don't think that you're going to achieve any of these :)If you got enrolled with him in any math course ever, send your prayer and hope you won't fuck up in that course.
Attending his class=nothing. You can use his lecture time to do other thing. His way of teaching is shit. You won't understand everything he said. I never see any math teachers or professors teach math only by reading all the letters in the notes. His notes contain a lot of words (in b/w) so you will have hard time understanding what he wrote on that paper.

Moreover, we need to learn about GNU Octave (Matlab rip-off because it's free) and he will do demonstration in several class that are somehow going to be tested in exam. But his demos were unclear and we don't have any time to ask him because he always moved on to other slidesThe course is divided into 2 parts; linear algebra and differential equation. The Linear Algebra part is quite manageable. The Differential equation part is tougher.Without a doubt one of the worst, if not, the worst professor in HKUST. He does not know how to teach at all. He teaches a Math course by reading off the presentation The presentation and lecture notes are mostly senseless. It's just full of symbols and a few basic examples.
He is unwilling to answer questions during lectures, and most of the time students are lost and have no clue of what is happening.
However you can't miss lectures because he demonstrates how to do some MATLAB commands. This demonstration is worse than his teaching. He just randomly types some commands in, and then shows the result and moves on.
I had to learn everything through the textbook, and had minimal use of lecture notes.
HKUST GET IT TOGETHER, WE ARE NOT PAYING YOU GOOD MONEY TO LEARN FROM TEXTBOOKS. REMOVE PROFESSORS LIKE THIS FROM YOUR STAFF.-Matrix (math2111)
-differetual equation(math2351)
-octaveHe really tried his best to teach, but he spoke too fast with many difficult math symbol. Also he used a lot of time to teach octave so always left less time on note. About hos note, very few example and most of them have NO STEP.CAUTION: DON'T register this course if you don't need!!! All statistical techniques you need can mostly learn from other fundamental stat. courses, which are also most of the pre-requisites of other stat.-related courses. What appears in this course is just the proof or technique used to derive the materials in those 2 courses.

Brief summary:
Part 1: Introduction (Basic knowledge will be used throughout this course)
- MGF, CLT, Multivariate normal distribution, Chi-square, t, F distribution & related confidence intervals, Order statistics

Part 2: Parameter Estimation (mostly focus on point estimation)
- Methods of finding estimators (MME, MLE), CRLB, requirements for the 'best' estimator: MVUE & UMVUE

Part 3: Hypothesis Testing
- introduction to H. test, Neyman-Pearson Lemma, UMP test, Likelihood ratio test, Pearson's goodness-of-fit test

Exams are cumulative that the part 1 and the first half of part 2 are included in the midterm and the final mainly examines the remains. The understanding of concepts may be a difficulty but for the exams, they are just step-by-step stuff.Prof. Wong is one of the good professors among the MATH department. She knows that this is a hard course for students (not for me) so she first suggested us to drop this course if you couldn't handle with what is taught in the add-drop period. Meanwhile, she demonstrated examples and explanations with details by hand-writing. I think this teaching strategy is more appropriate than just speaking with a monotone and powerpoints in a math course teaching proofs.
She is also kind for the students who want to ask for help. Just ask her if you can't understand the materials.

However, the speed may be a little bit slow since she has to make sure we can all understand the examples and the concepts. Attendance somehow is needed because she will only upload the hand-writing notes to who attend the lectures, and you may not able to get the full picture just from the notes.The course content are divided to 3 parts.
1. Central limit theorem/delta method/Moment generating function/..
2. Parameter estimation...
3. Hypothesis testing

Many proof and mathematics notations.
If you think math2421 is a boss, then I can tell you math2421 is just like a tiny baby in front of this course.
It is not a practical course. It focuses the concept of statistics so much. Pure math students may like this course.She is a nice person and have a good spoken English but her teaching style may not fit me.
In the class, she kept talking and writing the notes but the notes are not really well-organized.
I think it is quite extreme. Some students think she is the best professor in math department. Some are not.
TA always just reading the notes once... and done...First order ODEs
-Separable differential equations
-Homogeneous differential equations
-Inhomogeneous differential equations

Second order ODEs
-Homogeneous differential equations
-Inhomogeneous differential equations
-Laplace trasform
-Power series

System of differential equations
-Stability of fixed points

Fourier Series

Partial differentiation
- Separable equation

All of the content should be easily understandable if you have a fundamental background in calculus. More tricks to solve these differential equations such as the use of 'Ansatz' will be taught to you by the professor, but these new concepts should be easily grasped and understood if you have a solid understanding of calculus.The teaching was very clear by professor Chang, and he follows the order and format of the topics as given in the Chasnov- Introduction to Differential Equations book. The professor is easily understandable, with his accent not being too thick.

Lectures consists of the professor basically transferring the content of the book to the board, and the example questions he presents on the board are the same questions as seen in the book. So anyone can just read the book if they do not want to attend the lecture. However, the professor does explain step by step how he is able to solve the differential equations, and he will very helpfully and willingly answer questions after class. The professor will often add notes of his own in addition to the content on the book in order to explain concepts more clearly, so I do find going to lectures helped me a lot.

The lessons will include the professor talking about the topic for about half a lesson, then giving students a 5 minute break, before continuing with the rest of the lesson.Usual Content - ODE, Laplace Transforms, 2nd order DE, Homogenous and Non-Homogenous Eqns,

tutorial must goThe content of the course is fun. They course content is standard. There are new topics this year for example solving partial differential equations. However, the method to find the integrating factor for non linear odes aren't taught. This year's course content is very rewarding as while learning the way to solve the partial differential equations, we are taught the way to use them to solve the Schrodinger's equation, and we are not required to know how to solve the equation.The lecturer's teaching style is good. He explains the content well and covers all the important details of each of the concepts that he taught. You will be able to fully understand and how to use them. The TA also reviewed the content of the lecturers briefly and comprehensively.Solutions to different type of ordinary differential equations and some partial differential equations.Since the content of this course is just the solutions to different types of equations, the lecture is actually not so interesting. Just attending the tutorial can equip you with all the knowledge you need in exam as the questions in exam is very similar to that on the worksheets.First order equations, second order equations, Laplace transform method, numerical solution of initial value problems, boundary-value problems. Exclusion(s): MATH 2350, MATH 2352 Prerequisite(s): A passing grade in AL Pure Mathematics / AL Applied Mathematics; OR MATH 1014 OR MATH 1018 OR MATH 1020 OR MATH 1024

Normal topics as expected in an introductory diff. equation course. Off-balance because the final is too difficult because it has all the topics in the entire course and the last few topics are quite difficult.Prof. is alright, explains topics quite clearly with many examples. Spends most of the lecture time showing the derivations of the equations, formulas, and methods used, which are not required at all. It's fine to skip the lectures. They are recorded anyway.

The tutorials are really helpful. I had Dy Chun Yin (DDY) as the TA, he was excellent but unfortunately won't be teaching from next term onwards. Do not miss the tutorials, the practice is very helpful and also counts for 10% of the grade.first, second ode (application)

- pde (very simple)Professor Chasnov is great. His pronunciation is perfect (of course) and he goes through very detailed on every part of the program. Also, tutorial are important because if you practice on those problems, you will finally get a high mark.The content was basic, and if you have experience in calculus it should be easy. However, you are all by yourself in this course. TA and professor suck.One of the worst professors that I have had in UST so far. He does no0t know what he is speaking, and all students go to sleep in class. The others never show up, and the worst part was that the class was 9am. TA was better than the professor, but he struggled with English and often could not answer doubts.This course mainly taught you how to solve simple 1st order and 2nd order ODE
midterm: 1st order + simple 2nd order using characteristic equations
final: 8 questions in 2hrs, 3 for 2nd order(undetermined coef, euler, varaition of parameter), 2 for power series(1 using euler method), 1 for complex eigenvalue, 1 for system of ODE and the last is Laplace transform.
The Laplace transform is really complicated, and you better go through the questions in section 6.4 of your textbook.
The others are not so difficult, just be careful. And be aware that the time is not so enough.I think it is not a must for you to attend the lecture. I think it is fairly okay for you to go through the lecture, if you dont want to go to the lecture.

IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD GRADE, PLEASE ATTEND ALL TUTORIALS!!!
really important!! If is funny that the tutorial will cover all the final materials, and the TAs will mark the final paper. They will tell you what will be tested in the final.
For example, the prof had never taught about the format of doing the system of ODE, But the TA had shown all the steps in the tutorial You just need to memorize it and paste it to your final paper, then you can get this 5 points.
So please go all the tutorials and copy down everything the TA writes.Content tested in mid term is basically what they teach in high school or A-level. As for contents tested in finals, it doesn't teaches you how to solve a differential equation completely ie: finding one fundamental solution for a second order DE. Also, 3x3 system of 1st order equation was not taught. I really don't know how we can apply what we have learned in class considering we only know half of the methods to solve DEs.Unorganized, incoherent. Might as well self study.Ridiculous content. Boring lecture slides. Content could be made interesting if taught properly. Here are your options :
1. Don't take this course.
2. Take it with the other professor.
3. Be prepared for a unsatisfactory semester with this course.After doing MATH 2111 and MATH 2011, I can safely say that the teaching deserves an F but I don't see that option here. The faculty refuses to give any past papers. The professor sets a 3hr paper and asks us to solve it in 2 hrs.First Order Equations
Second Order Linear Equations
Series Solutions of Second Order Linear Equations

Systems of First Order Linear Equationsas listed by others, i don't want to repeat. but it is really interesting if you go to lecture every time because you can learn a lot of interesting things which will not be tested in exams but useful for further study and the beauty of mathvery clear teaching and brilliant methods to solve the questions.
better than reading the textbooks by yourself( you may see the attachment for basic information.)

Generally speaking, It is a greater course to introduce the FUNDAMENTAL math used in finance and insurance. Perhaps since I am a MATH major, I prefer to formulae and equations rather than words to understand the concept, and therefore, this course is much better than FINA2203/2303 for me, or somebody like me.
The reason why this course is great is its broadness and simplicity. It brings you into the different topics from shallow to deep : From the basic various concepts of "interest" for dealing with different type of series of cashflow (annuities) to their applications in loans, bonds and analysis of cashflows (NPV, IRR, dollar/time-weighted rate of return), and finally,  the course will introduce the concept of term structure of interest rate, forward rate, duration and convexity, which are the basic concepts in other financial topics like portfolio management, financial derivatives and risk hedging.
I think it is useful for MATH(SF-track) since you will take MATH4512 later (or now), which the materials in FINA2203 cannot sufficiently support you to understand Prof. K___'s "good" teaching as well as you can learn the similar thing in FINA2203 but in a more math way.
By the way, Please be noticed that it is also the pre-requisite of other important ACTM electives, like MATH 4427 (In the coming year, this will be divided into 2 courses) and MATH 4514. If you cannot handle with this course well, please re-decide whether you are suitable to the actuarial science since it is already a FUNDAMENTAL course.
By the way again, this course is designed for the SOA exam FM but some areas are not yet covered: Immunization, Interest Rate Swap, Determinants of Interest Rates. Except for the part of Immunisation, there are study notes on the website of SOA, so you may have to self-learn them if you want to take SOA exam.There are six chapters in total. 1. The basics of interest theory 2. Basic annuity theory 3.Loan repayment 4.Bonds and related topics 5.General cash flows and portfolios 6.Term structure of interest rates, Interest rate sensitivity and Bond immunization. The course only touches on the basics of each topic. The course is more of math than finance. Solving questions involve finding the unknowns from what is given. Solving a lot questions will guarantee a good score on the examinations.Teaching is very fast-paced. I did not miss any lectures because of this reason. The class usually ends 3 minutes late while trying to solve another question at the very end of the lecture.This course covers the fundamental concepts of actuarial financial mathematics and how these concepts are applied in calculating present and accumulated values for various streams of cash flows. The topics covered include interest rates, present value, annuities valuation, loan repayment, bond and portfolio yield, bond valuation, rate of return, yield curve, term structure of interest rates, duration and convexity of general cash flows and portfolios, immunization, stock valuation, capital budgeting, dynamic cash flow processes, and asset and liability management.very clear,
have many examplesTotal 6 Chapters
Please refer to the other comment from students . I would like to focus on Grading and Workload
PS: the content in summer course is a little bit less than that in regular semesterGreat and responsible prof. He is really nice and young . So the teaching is so interesting !
Moreover, he would talk about the SOA exam and the path in the first lesson < really helpful for those students would like to take minor in actuarial mathematics program and SOA examContent mainly covers basic knowledge of annuity and loan calculation. Content is suitable for a 2000 level course.Professor provides a lot of practice paper and full solutions for students. If you do all the questions, I ensure you can get A range in this course as both of the mid-term and Final exam's questions are the practice exercises you did before.This course prepares students to take the SOA F/M examination. It is also suited to students who wish to understand the mathematics underlying loans, bonds, and some simpler stocks. The knowledge is entirely cumulative, with knowledge previously learned in the course essential to understanding the later parts. The knowledge itself is simple, the proofs are straightforward with only elementary mathematics necessary, and the applications are plentiful.Dr. Huang is without a doubt an extremely hard-working instructor. He teaches very clearly and explains all the proofs and origins of equations. Sometimes this is excessive but it is worth listening during the lecture because he always delivers financial intuition associated with equations.
Dr. Huang also uploads every single video of his lectures as well as the class script that is projected to the screen of diagrams. He responds to feedback regarding his teaching very well because he strives to ensure all students learn well.- Vectors; lines and planes
- Functions of several variables
- Partial differentiation; extrema
- Double and triple integrals
- Vector fields; grad, div, curl
- Line, surface and volume integrals
- Integral theorems

The topics, although difficult both conceptually and mathematically, are all very interesting and useful for math and physics majors.He is a strict teacher and always treats us like high school students. That's why I never liked him.

His teaching is tedious as well.

However his notes and exercises are quite good (but they have some gaps that he expects you to fill in in class.)This course is very useful for math/phys/engine students.
- multiple integral
- partial differentiation
- vector
- green theorem
- line integral

I mean the content is helpful for you major but not meaning he teaches well...I don't like his teaching style. Also, I don't think he could explain the concept very clearly. Usually, he explained a concept very quick and then jump into next one.This course is a direct follow-up to content from MATH1014 Calculus II. After reviewing concepts on vectors and equations in three dimensions, the course introduces multivariable functions. Key concepts include:
- Arc-length Parametrization
- Partial Derivatives & Chain Rule
- Directional Derivatives & Gradients
- Tangent Planes, Critical Points
- Lagrange's Multipliers
- Double & Triple Integrals
- (Conservative) Vector Fields & Line Integrals
- Surface Parametrization & Surface Flux
- Green's, Stokes' & Divergence TheoremsProf. Fong has prepared a beautiful summary document of lecture content, organized like a short textbook. His lecture slides are written in class, and extremely organized and easy to follow. Every class follows the same format: review, lecturing main concepts, and examples. This format made content easy to learn and understand.
Prof. Fong is also very approachable and willing to help. He gives very good guidance when we do not know how to approach a practice problem.Covers differentiation and integration in multiple variables (at most 3), vector fields and their respective applications.
A strong foundation in basic calculus is highly recommended, as they will be necessary throughout the course, but they won't be taught (such as differentiation by parts, etc.). I suggest revising the basics again before taking this course.
Mostly working within 3D space.The professor explains everything clearly, and his diagrams are neat. He is also patient in answering our questions. The professor also uploads interactive 3D graphs which help us to better grasp the complex concepts in 3D space.Multi variable Calculus of course teaching you how to do with 2 or 3 variables in the same time. (But as a Math student, I really don't understand why there is no any Honor courses for people who like to think about multi-variables, like n variables or do things in general)

That means it only covers 2 to 3 variables (x, y and z). Students who have studied M2 in their secondary schools may have some advantages since the content will cover vectors, dot product and cross product in first few lectures. People who are good at space thinking are encouraged to study this course, since it will be a good grade course for you.The lecturer is very funny, a Hong Kong lecturer who can make you laugh at his lecture. But the pronunciation of English is really make me feel annoying. Try not to miss any class, he is really a funny guy.

The TA is also a Hong Kong resident, but sometimes may make me feel unhappy especially when I asked him questions. He tried to define every thing very rigorously, e.g. you need to be careful on "derivative" and "differentiation". If you asked him using a wrong word, he will be angry on you and you will feel unhappy. Since that time, I never attend his tutorial lessons any more.Workload is not heavy, with only vectors, differential and integrals.

Constant reviewing is important. It is hard to memorize them. Understanding can help you feel better.Good teaching!The content is appropriate, not too difficult nor too easy. The course focuses on the reasons and proofs behind each theorem or statement.Professor Fung has a sense of humor and he explains the theories and logic well. He tells stories in class about Stokes and Green to wake people up (he claims).
His notes are easy to understand. He also tells us which part is important in the notes.The content is a little bit difficult but very interesting. And it's a basic course that is useful for many other subjects. You need to listen to class carefully or you may not get A range.Jimmy's class is very interesting and never make you feel sleepy. His teaching is responsible and detailed. Also the materials is comprehensive, including notes and graphs.Great content. Covers most if not all of the core concepts in multivariable calculus. The course also explores interesting applications in other fields, most especially physics.

Lecture notes are quite helpful.Professor Zhang uploads the lecture material after every lecture. Most of the examples he uses are from the lecture notes (which he uploads at the start of the semester), so if you've read the notes ahead of time, it should be easy to follow. It's a bit boring at times but in general it's fine. He's also really open to questions, so feel free to ask. No attendance.

The TA Hoi was excellent. He tried to engage the class, would give us tips, and would really try his best to help us understand. He's also makes jokes and is pretty lively.Content before the mid-term includes:
Partial Derivatives & Chain Rule
Directional Derivatives & Gradients
Tangent Planes, Critical Points
Lagrange's Multipliers

Content after the mid-term includes:
Double & Triple Integrals
Vector Fields & Line Integrals
Surface Parametrization & Surface Flux
Green's, Stokes' & Divergence TheoremsProf. Mu Mo's pronunciation was very bad, thus it was very difficult to understand what he was saying. Few weeks after the beginning of the term, I chose to self-study for this class for the rest of the semester instead. Also, the TA was not good at teaching, although he seemed quite enthusiastic about providing us as much useful materials for better understanding of the lecture materials as possible.The course content is the same as previous semesters, except that in the exams the professor will focus more on the calculations part instead of the proofs of the theorems since most of the students are not math majors but engineering and other science majors students, lolMomu CANNOT teach at all
His teaching is weird and boring
I got through the course without listening to his lectures at all
The TA, Yiyi, ins't any better in his tutorials, but he regularly update students about the topics covered and also provided some questions and solutions through email.Vector-valued functions
Multi-variable functions - partial derivatives
Multi-variable functions - multiple integrals
Vector fieldsexcellent teaching
the content of the notes is mostly well-explainedVector-valued functions
Multi-variable functions - partial derivatives
Multi-variable functions - multiple integrals
Vector fieldsLecture notes are easy to follow. Professor Mu, Mo is very passionate about teaching.Expands on the ideas covered in single variable calculus to multi-variables, including vector calculus, partial and full differentials of multivariable functions, critical points of multivariable functions. Other topics also involve applying theories in partial and full differentials to the application of making linear approximations. Other topics covered in this course involve integration in multi-variables and vector fields.Teaching in lectures if very straight forward and clear. Lecture notes are well structured and synchronised to the lectures teaching method and order.Professor Jimmy Fung has reduced some topics as he found out that there is insufficient time to cover all of them. In this course, you can't just memorize all the equations only, it is better to know the derivation. He might test you on it and there are not much of numerical calculations. It is important to keep practicing on the derivations.I really like his teaching. He always welcome questions from students and encourage interactions, although most of the time we just sit back on our seats quietly. He not only teach us Mathematics but also attitude. He encouraged us to be passionate, hardworking and persistent.The content is just right, not much. However, the content is much more difficult compared to MATH1xxx course.Dont know coz i didnt attend any class.The grade is good. I got around +0.3 s.d. and i am scored a B. It is quite good in math course. The midterm is easy but the final exam is much much much more difficult. None of questions in the final exam i think i can get it all correct. but turns out i got above mean in the final exam too.

Of course, even though i didnt attend any lesson but still above mean, it doesnt mean that the course is easy to got above mean. One reason is that i just have a good foundation on calculus.Not much. Just like other math course having a weekly webworkMultivariable calculus. Lots of theorems and geometrical interpretation. All of these are of crucial importance for later studies.Funny teaching style.
He explained things in fine details, really helps us to get to know how different theorems work out. Unlike other courses which I forget all of them after the semester, I can still recall some knowledge that I learnt in this course.Mainly deals with vectors, lagrange multiples, multiple integrals, regions in 3D(Type 1,2 and 3), line integral, conservative fields and three big theorems, Green, Stoke and Divergence,his teaching is very clear. accents and pronunciations are fairly pleasant hearing. lectures are well paced, rarely runs out of time. Prof. Ku is very willing to answer  questions during the lecture or after class in his office room.very nice person,Multivariable calculas
Including:
Calculus (differentiate,integrate) involved multiple variables,
don't worry, at most three
Vector fields
And their applications respectivelyI have to speak highly of the professor because he teaches fairly well. He is patient when you come to ask him questions and he explains the concept in detail and a straight-forward way.Differentiation and Intergation in 3D or even higher dimensions.
It just make the things you learn in 1013 and 1014 complex because you considering more dimendions.
Principle are basically same but you got lots more equatons but no chestsheet in exam.Mo Mu often used the blackboard to proof the identity in the notes and sometimes they will appear in your tests so you better jot them down.
He sometimes can be boring and reluntant to answer your questions but only sometimes.
His notes used the previous lecturer's one and they are not enough. You must attend the class.
The tutorial is important also. The tutor and his notesreally help me a lot.Quite interesting. But sometimes quite boring. Jimmy sometimes absents and need to have extra lessons. Extra lessons must be attended so as to catch up the courseNot bad at all. Students must attend all his classes so as to understand the concept. Homework material is very important. Final exam is just like homework exerciseContent is intense, yet was presented in an appropriate sequence.Jimmy Fung is a nice guy and a good, passionated teacher. I like his teaching style although sometimes it takes me a lot effort to catch up. I can always remember his rice bowl lol
Zeta is also instructed clearly, and is quite helpful.Before midterm:
- vector
- line and plan
- limit in 2 variables
- continuity and differentiability
- chain rule
- gradient and rate of change locally
- find max and min of functions and critical points

After midterm:
- chain rule
- integral in 2 and 3 variables
- change of variables (polar, spherical, cylindrical)
- line integral
- flux integral
- fundamental theorem of line integral
- green's, stokes' and divergence theoremEnglish is very bad, also he laughs every time, so you cannot follow his words.
TA is very great, he spends every minute on talking about exercise similar to the ones who appears in midterm and final.Sequences, series, gradients, chain rule. Extrema, Lagrange multipliers, line integrals, multiple integrals. Green's theorem, Stroke's theorem, divergence theorem, change of variables.Jimmy Fung's teaching is really good. His english is really good and easy to udnerstand. In addition, he always tries to make jokes to lighten up the whole class. His explanations are also really in depth.It covers mainly the basics of Analysis of functions. Later on there will also be insights into basic integration up to differentiating functions with a plynom of grade 4 and above.
Students learn about all the main content of Calculus I and II in course. Therefore it is very time intesifying and should be absloved only with prior math knowledge.As everything is written on internet presentations, it is not necessary to go to the teaching. I aquired my knowledge mostly online.The course is teaching the content of both MATH 1013 and 1014. Epsilon-delta proof of limits is difficult. Also some other new concepts which is not a part of M2.Avery's teaching is good. His board-writing is clear. However, the lecture notes does not help a lot. Homework is not that useful, even the past paper. The TA prepares some difficult materials for us to learn, resulted in bad understanding.It was the worst shit of my life. Even though it is a beginner's math class my friend told me there are many things they haven't learnt even in HL IB maths!His lectures are super boring. All he does is write theories and proves them but he never teaches how to solve certain questions.Ok grading. I think you can pass with a 30% from what I've heard.There is homework every week. About 5-15 questions. The homework is submitted online via webwork. There is an unlimited amount of trials to answer the questions.Week 1 Review of the concepts of functions and graphs.

Week 12 Definite integrals; Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Week 13 Net change; substitution rule.The examples given in the lecture are important for the mid term and final.
In fact, you can skip most of exercise if you understand those examples.Very basic. If you've studied calculus before, you should have no problem regarding the content of this course.At times, you may be better off not attending the lectures - the lecturer has a tendency of making simple calculations/steps incredibly confusing.Scoring the mean will give you a C. Their way of marking exams (whether it be midterm or final) is very specific - if you do not follow specific steps to obtain the final answer, you'll get a third of the overall mark for the question despite getting the correct answer. In your answers, you'll also have to be clear and precise; otherwise, no marks will be given for your points unfortunately.With webwork due every week, along with a "quiz", workload is adequate.Week 1 Review of the concepts of functions and graphs.

Mainly content:
differentiation , integration, rolle's theorem, mean value theorem , intemediate value theorem, integration by substitution....Dr. Avery Ching is a good tutor.   He can explain some concept clearly. He is one of my favorite professor.Week 1 Review of the concepts of functions and graphs.  (1.2-1.3; Appendix A.)

The content is adequate to explain fundamentals of calculus, but for better coverage, I recommend to learn the content from MIT OCW.Avery has a strong Hong Kong accent, it may be quite intimidating for students as he said many 'ah, er, la'
He mainly focuses on proofs and steps of the examples, however, the examples he lists were too basic compared to the exam ones.
TA (Zeta) was impeccable in his teaching, his examples were relevant to the exams and were well-explainedIntro to calculus. Topics include: Functions, Limits, Derivatives, Optimization, Integration.

Midterm mostly tested limits and final was predominantly on derivatives and integration. Make sure to know your graphs because both exams have long graph sketching questions.

Final is all inclusive, including midterm.Professor is extremely bad at explaining, heavy accent, makes easy concepts very complicated.

It's better to skip lectures (No attendance, so its ok) and study lecture notes by yourself, with help from youtube videos e.g. Khan Academy to understand concepts rather than go to lectures and try to understand the professor.

TAs are more helpful, especially Dave. Be sure to go to tutorials.Week 1 Review of the concepts of functions and graphs.  (1.2-1.3; Appendix A.)

The TA (AU, Cheuk Yin), He is very, very useful in tutorials, and his way of teaching is very easy to understand.He has notes for the tutorials, and easy to understand.GOOD!!!!!!!Basic calculus. The concept is entirely new for students without HKDSE M1/M2 experience.
Includes limit, differentiation, integration.Avery's teaching makes the course hard to follow. I am not a math head and didn't know what he was teaching half of the lecture.

TA Zeta Chan was very helpful. He explained the steps and reasoning very well in tutorials and provided adequate exercise for us.

I gave up after 2 weeks and didn't attend the lectures very often. I went to all the tutorial and finished all the tutorial questions by myself.

I think watching khan academy is adequate for everyone to understand the course content. There is no need for attending the lecture.It's way too hard for students who never studied calculus.His accent was weird and it is hard to understand. He only tries to explain each theory in class once and skips all the steps. He leaves the calculation stuff to the TAs. The TAs are way better in teaching in how to calculate.The content is quite packed and there are quite a lot concepts to remember. It is really hard for those who had not taken M1/M2The professor's teaching is really bad, he just read from the powerpoint and did not thoroughly explain the underlying principles.He always come late and is not patient enough when asking him questionsWeek 1 Review of the concepts of functions and graphs.

Don't waste your time, try study by your own or go to math center. definitely usefuler than sitting in the lecture hall coping notes .however, if you want to pass you must !!!!!!!!! go to the tutorial ,it's more practical and  tutors may also give you some very very useful tips for the exam . Strongly recommend you tofinish all the question they gave you to practise. at least you will know what midterm and final look like.Just some introduction to calculus. Easy to handle if you are willing to spend time after lessons.

Week 13 Net change; substitution rule.Avery's lesson will make you sleep and you will copy a lot of concepts and definitions which are not too useful in your exams. There are little examples which will help you understand the concepts and applications but still not too useful.

Zeta's tutorial will focus on more useful applications of the theories in exams and there will be a thick practice. It is suggested to complete much of the practice if you have not learn calculus before or you are not so familiar with the concepts. It is really useful.

Because of the length of the course, Avery and Zeta will have to rush through the contents, there will be little time for you to do exercise. To catch up, you will have to spend much time doing Zeta's exercise at home.

It is suggested to take Zeta's notes even though you are not enrolled in Zeta's tutorial.too difficult for the one who approach calculus for the first time
mainly focus on differentiation , integration , and the graphing
the time allocation is badly planned, the most difficult part use the least time to teachthe teaching is extremely bad, just teach us theory and its proof, does not teach us how to apply the theory and how to use the theory practicallyStraight forward. M2 things and new rules.
notes same for every year. Refer to sources if you want to study beforehand.Detailed explanation. English good enough for a maths professor.
suggest ppl without M1/M2 background to attend tutorials or watch video for tutorials.

********there are no videos for lectures********only tutorials are taped.DSE M2 stuff
Avery does the proving and Zeta does Maths questions with youAvery proved the equations or concepts, which turned out to be quite boring to students who do not have a great interest in mathematics so I skipped his lectures later on. And he spoke quite slow and in Hong Kong-ish English.
Zeta, on the other hand, taught really fast and precise, sometimes a bit too fast that it was not easy to follow. The good thing is that he uploaded his class videos a day or two after so you can watch it again to make yourself understand better. You can benefit quite a lot as long as you really finish exercises he assigned and try your best to follow.mostly like  M2 in DSE
content is 90% the same with math 1013
mainly learn the limit, differentiation, derivativehis teaching is very boring for me, mainly explain the math concept, very difficult to understand, almost skip all the lecture as his lecture is always at 9 am and will fall asleep easily
the tutorial is more helpful for me and i attend the most tutorial, will teach how to do exerciseWeek 1 - Functions and graphs, exponential functions, transformations of graphs
Week 2 - Logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions
Week 3 - Trigonometric identities, concept of a limit
Week 4 - One-sided limits, infinite limits and limits at infinity
Week 5 - Continuity, concept of a derivative
Week 6 - Differentiation rules
Week 7 - Chain rule, implicit differentiation
Week 8 - Higher derivatives, rate and related rates
Week 9 - Minimum and maximum
Week 10 - Optimization, L'Hopital Rule
Week 11 - Anti-derivatives, indefinite integrals
Week 12 - Definite integrals, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)
Week 13 - Substitution methodIf you have any questions, you could feel free to ask the professor. He is really nice and able to explain it quite detailed. However, the TA does not have such patience. If you don't understand after her explanation, don't ask her again. Try to ask the professor.a lot of topics are required to studyThe teaching of avery is boring and theoretical. Since mid-September  , I skipped all the lecture by Avery and only attended the tutorial. Zeta's teaching is focus on examination skills so will be more useful of the people that are weak at MathsAs its course name, mainly cover calculus stuffs like limits, derivatives and integration. As a course designed for students who have not studied calculus during secondary education, it is really hard to catch up with the content.Very, very bad. Avery only focus on concepts but dont really teach how to solve the questions. Kitty, the TA,  also teaches poorly. In her tutorials, she often calculate the questions wrongly herself and only usually only about 10 students attend her tutorials. On the other hand, Zeta, who will teach one lecture session, do demonstrate how to solve different kinds of problems and in a relatively good way. He also prepared a set of exercises for us and if you do all questions in it, it should be able to help you understand more.Pre calculus (identities, arcsin, arccos, arctan etc)

Fundamental thm of calculusKitty is an inadequate tutorial instructor. All she does is mutter and write out the answers for the exercises without explaining adequately. Her tutorial is useless. And when u ask her questions, she justs give short, abrupt  answers with no elaboration. Simply put, she's a good mathematician, but by no means an adequate instructor
Many ppl dont like the instructor, Avery but he's actually very good. His explanations can be long winded but the details in his steps are very important. If u understand those details, the webwork will be very easy. Helpful instructor, will answer any questions u may hv. His exam questions are quite tricky. Some are taken out of webwork.
IA Zeta Chan(not found in instructor column) is the best. Explains very clearly. Best presentation and the most prepared. Also since his sessions are recorded, it is easy to catch up. His lectures revise Avery's main pts so all the essentials are there.M2 stuff including functions,limits,differentiation and integration but some of them are Pure Math like L'Hopital's RuleHis accent may not be acceptable for someone as he has heavy Cantonese accent.
Most of the example and proof he teaches can be found on his website,but some of the examples may be presented in a different way.
He teach with heart in fact but there are not many people like having his lessonMost of them are about M2 stuff( Limit, Differentiation, Integration) with some new contents( Sandwich Theorem, Lhopital Rule).

For the details, please refer to other's reviews.In the lecture session, Avery mainly focuses on the proving of different equations. Although they are completely trashy that could never be used in the exam, you might somehow find them interesting. Just like you know 1+1=2 , but you have never been told what caused it to be neither in primary school nor secondary school. If you want to explore the secrets of Mathematics as a Math fanactic. Go for it.

If you just want to have a good grade, you MUST go to the tutorial session, be it Kitty's or Zeta's. In Kitty's tutotial, the good thing is that her notes are very comprehensive and neat with the working steps clearly shown, despite her weakness in explaning stuff( or my weakness in understanding lol). In Zeta's tutorial, he will show many examples of different types of questions. If you are stuck at some junctures and ask him, he can point it out quickly and clarify your mind. So, depends on which way of learning you prefer, choose the tutorial to go.Same as other reviews, not too many changes, also teach from the basic limits concept, differentiation, integration and their applications.For the main lecture, Avery taught the concepts and proofs with his hand written notes. Same contents would be written down together with students in different lecture section. But after finishing 1 topic, there was a pdf ver. notes uploaded on Avery's own website. That notes should be a part of the reference book, and almost same as Avery hand written one.

For another lecture and tutorial session, Zeta and Kitty will do their demonstrations respectively. Exercises were provided by Zeta and needed to collect from the Math Support Center. Although it was thick, it won't be too challenging for the students who had studies M1/2 during secondary school.

For the WebWork, it provided unlimited attemps so it also not a big problem. Web search is ok when doing the exercise and easy to calculate them outIt is M2 stuff more than M1  from what I have heard (but I didn't study M1M2 before so I can't tell the difference). But the main flow goes from precalculus->limit & continuity-> differentiation and application -> integration

For the tutorial, the tutor doesn't seem to know what she is doing and how to tutor. So study by yourself is actually more effective than listening to their teaching.- calculus from zero

Note that the pace of teaching is fast. Spending effort to keep up with the pace is quite a must.CHENG, Kam Heng:
Yes. I attend MATH1013's lecture instead of 1012's. Avery is quite infamous afterall.

Henry prepares very detailed notes and additional practices (which are very difficult), but you may need to individually ask him in order to gain the access on canvas.

He will write out all the stuff (proofs and solutions) on the whiteboard. Making sure you are with him when he is writing.

There is a break within every lecture. Feel free to ask him questions when in doubt. His explanation is generally detailed and understandable.
Right before midterm and final, he will teach us to do some past paper questions. 1013's questions are really challenging when compared to 1012's.

Zeta Chan:
Exam-oriented style. You should take a copy of his note and do practices on the questions of the note. This is particularly important for those who didn't study M2 before.

His explanation to solving questions is clear. Attending his tutorial is really quite optional because there are recorded videos uploaded on canvas afterwards. Of course, you might need to ask him questions and you better attend the tutorial if so (there will be more guys waiting for him in MSC).Content is pretty okay if I'm being honest. I did IB Math Studies (lol) and I was able to eventually understand and comprehend everything, so don't be too worried if you're bad at math. The main focus of this course is limits, derivatives, and integration. Everything else is minor and is just based off those main three.

Make sure you understand related rates and optimization. They love to test on those!Just. No. You can get much better teaching from the following links:

and KhanAcademyLecture not very useful but tutor is very good. Especially Zeta. Although he sometimes will have a bad mood. Mainly limit, differentiation and integration.He will keep on write different notes in the lecture and try to teach you how to do the question by theory. Mainly theory and he will seldom teach how to do a question. Therefore, I don't really think his teaching is good.All M2 stuff, DSE level. But it is so tedious if you have no fundamental math background as it is a 4 credit bearing course.The teacher emphasises on self learning process such as flipped class. He is lenient to students and I think he is capable to teach.Average

Mid term mean 17, highest 44 I got 21, just above mean. I predict I can have a B- if I continue to be above meanVery light, only 3 canvas questions per 2 weeks (around) Go to lessons on time for attendance marksBasic concepts of calculus including differentiation and integration.

1. Pre-calculus
2. Limits
3. Differentiation
4. IntergrationSince I have never attend any of the classes, nothing much I can say about the teaching.1) Pre-calculus (including types of various functions etc.)
2) Limit (limit, asymptotes etc.)
3) Differentiation (differentiation techniques, L’Hospital’s Rule, curve sketching etc.)
4) Integration (indefinite integral, summation, fundamental theorem of calculus)

The course introduces the basics of calculus to students without DSE M1/M2. I think this course is indeed very suitable for beginners. And thanks to this course, I could then handle MATH 1014 in spring.Dr. Ching is quite good at explaining the basic ideas in calculus. As a beginner, I think his lectures are effective to introduce me the new concepts.

TA Zeta is very helpful and his tutorial notes are good.Basic calculus
Includes limit, differential calculus, integral calculus.Avery's teaching makes the course hard to follow.

TA Kitty Lee's tutorials were far from satisfactory. Not only her tone was larthargic, but also with an extremely slow teaching speed.

TA Zeta Chan Yun Hung was very helpful. He explained the steps,tho not quite thoroughly, and provided enough practice questions for us. You can find him at MSC.

My course is 9am class and I often skipped lectures of Avery. I stopped going to the tutorial since I found that useless.

I think Youtube and khan academy helped me a lot in understanding the course. So even if you skip lectures, it will be totally fine.This is an introductory course in one-variable calculus, the first in the Calculus I and II sequence, designed for students that have not taken HKDSE Mathematics Extended Module M1 or M2. Topics include functions and their limits, continuity, derivatives and rules of differentiation, applications of derivatives, and basic integral calculus.Zeta is the best. Remember to go math support center that can help u a lot.Took the course during a regular semester, as one  of my pre reg. Had no previous exposure to calculus. Learning all those concept with so little time is  definitely torture.Not. Helping. At. ALL.
Attending lectures and tutorial won't do any good. Rotting in library might make a bigger difference than the lectureWeek 1 concepts of functions and graphs.

Actually not different from MATH 1013, just to separate students into 2 groupsAlbert Ku did try to make the lesson more funny, but seems unsuccessful..
For the content taught, some methods and ways he explained will simply make you further confused..For HKDSE students: This is simply most of the M2, compressed into a course to be studies in 1 semester.

For other students: This is Extended Maths.

Be prepared.Make sure to go to his lessons because he has only 4 handouts and no make up videos.

The handouts give you no information about how to solve a math problem, there were only practice questions.

And he teaches poorly.DSE M2
Function, limits, differentiation and some integrationThis course covers:
1. Limit
2. Differentiation
3. Integration

An introduction to calculus. The content is almost the same with calculus 1B, but a simplified version.Avery Ching's lecture is quite clear, but boring. You can skip the lectures and it won't be a problem. Mostly he prove formulas during his lectures. There are 3 lectures per week, and Avery teaches 2 of them. The third lecture is taught by the TA, Chan Yun-Hyung. It is better, plus he gives out lecture notes on his lecture.

The tutorials are more helpful than lectures, as the TA discuss problems, not just concepts like in lectures.basic calculus knowledge including pre-calculus, limit, derivative, antiderivative andintegral
It may be hard to catch up for calculus begininners as the course covers too many things within short period.The professer seems to avoid eye contact but explains given examples very kindly. Also his lecture notes are clear. However, as we have limited during lectures, you'd better attend tutorials for better understanding and more practice.integration and differentiation
but the LQ maybe too difficultthe lecturer(avery) was poor but the tutor (Au ching yin)was very good who was nice and with a sense of humour.I enjoyed his lesson very much ................quite good if you paid enough efforts
I got 4x/50 in midterm but 7x/100 in final and finish all the web work in MSC
the grade is much better than Math 1013web work only no other assignments
if you think it is not enough,you can look for some other differentiation exerciseHard for non-math background students
Not enough background information
Need more easy and understandable questions to start withHard to understand what the professor says.
Not adequate for the exam
Less information given and not enough teaching contentsAdvanced Secondary M1/M2 stuff
Quite difficult for non M1/M2 student
integration and differentiation and other content will be taughtInteresting but too much theory involved instead of practical usage
but professor is still quite interesting and the lecture are not too boring
there will be break in the middle of the lectureA course about one-variable calculus.He have a very heavy accent. I can't really understand what he taught in class and he solved some really easy questions in a extremely complicated way.Homework 15%
Midterm 35%
Final 50%

I got 48/50 for midterm and 91/100 for final. I got A+ at last.Workload is really light for me. I didn't really go to class throughout the semester, less than five times I guess, and the only thing I do was finish the online homework which I spend only at most an hour on.The content is very difficult to understand by the person without any previous knowing about calculus. The content is too much for a course within one semester which let students to have a hard time following up.The professor has a very large accent which makes the english hard to understand. The teaching was about to prove the calculus rules but not how to use them. Going to lectures seemed not useful in passing in midterms and finals.Week 1 Review of the concepts of functions and graphs
Week 2  functions.  
Week 3 Tangent and velocity; the limit of  a function and laws
Week 4 Continuity; limit at infinity; limit definition of derivative and rates of change
Week 5 differentiation rules
Week 6 Chain rule and implicit differentiation
Week 7 Rates and related rates
Week 8 Mean Value Theorem. Maximum and minimum values
Week 9 Derivatives and the shape of a graph; L'Hopital's Rule.
Week 10 Curve sketching,  optimization problems
Week 11 Antiderivatives,  areas and distance travelled
Week 12 Definite integrals; Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Week 13 substitution ruleThe prof doesn't explain the concepts clearly and most of the students can hardly understand the concepts behind. However, the tutorials are far more useful. It is worth to attend the tutorials so as to get a better understanding on the content.The content is too hard for beginners and the schedule is outrageously packed. The content is too hard for beginners and the schedule is outrageously packed. The content is too hard for beginners and the schedule is outrageously packed.The accent of the professor is so disturbing and it's too hard for students to understand everything he says.The accent of the professor is so disturbing and it's too hard for students to understand everything he says.Content is actually not that hard to grasp, the main focus is on differential calculus and limits. It starts basic with functions, (easier) limits then into derivatives, graphing and integration.
Topics are easy to follow as long as you practice the concept.Avery's teaching is.... complicated. His accent is often hard to understand and distracting. He takes too many variables and notations to explain simple concepts, which can be confusing to many students (including me).
I would recommend going to tutorials and lecture by the TA instead, as they explain how to do questions and are generally helpful. Dave's (Au, Cheuk Yin) notes and explanations seemed good and he explained concepts well too.This course is difficult for most students who didn't study m2 in secondary school since most of the content is similar to MATH1013 added to some pre-calculus content such as radian, absolute value. The time given is obviously insufficient and we can hardly understand and handle those questions related to integration.Ku's teaching is good that he provided quite a lot examples for us and they included some special skills. Ku's notes are painstaking and clear.  Ching's teaching is bad that he just gave some useless definitions instead some simple and easy-understanding examples.this course suppose for the one who never study m2  but teaching nearly whole dse content in 3 month, how can we suppose to catch up?
it is hard for the one who have not study m2 before to catch uplectures are rubbish , no direct relation between the lecture and the exam . the tutorial is more useful since it teaches you how to do question and give time to you to practice.For those who does not take M1/M2 in DSE, Content is basically the same with 1013 but with one more lecture.

Content mostly covered by M2 of DSE and  with a bit more advanced knowledge.

Review for Final ExamTeaching is quite clear, he will ask us if we can follow or have any problem.

The course starts from the very beginning, where you learn about functions and limits before stepping into the world of calculus. As seen from the schedule above, the course content is not extremely tough, but students with no calculus background might find the exams a little bit challenging.Albert is a decent lecturer. He is capable of delivering the course contents in an effective way. He places a lot of effort in making powerpoints, online self-learning materials as well as assignments and quizzes. He is very willing to answer students' questions and explains mathematical problems with examples in a good and logical way. If you attend all the lessons, understand the examples and work on the practices, you will do fine.

The TA, Kitty, is fair. She prepares a lot of exercises for practicing the learned topics. However, her delivery in English is average. She sometimes looks shy and speaks really softly.I never study calculus before(in HKDSE). However, I found the difficulty of the course is reasonable and the instructor could explain those concepts with graphs or detailed procedures. Quite a lot of topics but the questions were not at an advanced level so beginners also can catch up easily.

I don't like Piazza. It is too difficult to use, especially for a mobile phone user.The instructor is nice and responsible, he can explain the concepts clearly with his powerpoint but a bit of boring as he always waits for student's responses. All in all, he did a good job. However, the tutor( Kitty) could not explain the question very clearly and personally I think the tutorial is useless, I only attended for 3(?) lessons.Week 1 Review of the concepts of functions and graphs.  (1.2-1.3; Appendix A.)
Week 2 Elementary functions.  (1.5-1.6; Appendix B-D.)
Week 3 Tangent and velocity; the limit of a function and limit laws.  (2.1-2.3.)
Week 4 Continuity; limit at infinity; limit definition of derivative and rates of change.  (2.5-2.7.)
Week 5 Derivatives of basic functions; differentiation rules.  (2.8, 3.1-3.3.)
Week 6 Chain rule and implicit differentiation.  (2.8, 3.1-3.3.)
Week 7 Rates and related rates.  (3.7-3.9.)
Week 8 Mean Value Theorem. Maximum and minimum values.  (3.10, 4.1.)
Week 9 Derivatives and the shape of a graph; L'Hopital's Rule.  (4.3-4.4.)
Week 10 Curve sketching; optimization problems.  (4.5-4.7.)
Week 11 Antiderivatives; areas and distance traveled.  (4.9, 5.1.)
Week 12 Definite integrals; Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  (5.2-5.3.)
Week 13 Net change; substitution rule.  (5.4-5.5.)The teaching was not as good as I expected. His English accent was not good so I had a hard time to understand in the beginning. However, he uploads his lecture notes every time after the lecture to his course website, and that is really useful.The content is quite difficult, but its just basic calculus stuff. The main focus is on Limits, Differentiation and Integration, the stuff he did before barely came up on the test and is mostly basic graph and trig knowledge.Avery likes to jump around and sometimes does not explain his steps very well. He does give a lot of examples though.

He also teaches us proof which we will never use unless you are doing maths as a major.All about Dse M2The lecture is useless , tutor zeta chan is quite helpfulWebwork 15%

Me myself found M2 textbooks very helpful in MATH 1012.
(Yes, M1 materials are less helpful than M2 materials.)
The teaching pace is indeed very fast, going through functions, limits, derivatives, application of derivatives and integrals in the 3 months.
quite chur for those who did not study any extended math in secondary school, like me.He puts handwritten lecture notes in his course website.
If you are good in self-study, you do not have to go to his lectures and you can just read the lecture notes to learn.
His overall teaching is satisfactory.
I would recommend you to go to Zeta's lecture instead, his lecture is quite exercise- based.Easy for those who took Extended Maths during DSE
Hard to catch up if you didn't study calculus before
5 topics in 3 months so the prof goes really fast to ensure that all the topics are covered in time for examIt is very hard to understand what the prof is saying 90% of the time, so it's better to skip lectures and study on your own. Attend tutorials as the TA will help with all the problemsSimilar to secondary school's M1/M2 but included more content
Those who did not study M1/M2 before need more effort to catch up since the content of this course is similar to 1013 and one should not expect that this course is easier than 1013If you like maths, the teaching is good, since his teaching can improve your thinking in mathematics. Otherwise, if you only want to develop practical skills in doing maths, the lecture is boring to you, just go for the tutorial in this case. The TA's teaching is pretty good and his advice is precise and accurate.Content is suitable for beginners in Calculus, although the pace is quite fast and there are a lot of topics to cover. Definitely should practice from the textbooks as they give you the correct mindset to solve problems.

Topics include:
Functions and their graphs;
Trigonometric functions, exponential and log functions and their inverses;
Limits, asymptotes of graphs, continuity;
Derivatives of elementary functions, product and quotient rules, chain rule.
Implicit differentiations.
Rate of changes.
Extremums of functions. The mean value theorem.
Increasing and Decreasing functions. Curve sketching.
Optimizations.
L'hôpital rule.
Riemann sums and definite integrals. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Integration by Substitution.

Don't freak out when the professor gives you extremely difficult past papers, I promise you that in reality, the midterms and the finals aren't that difficult!Although the professor (CHING, Avery) is very smart, he is unable to teach well; it is quite difficult to follow what he is saying in lectures. He starts off with easy, understandable concepts, and the other minute he immediately starts solving a very difficult problem.

Similarly, the TA (CHAN, Yun Hung) often teaches in lectures as well. It's quite difficult to understand his accent, plus his teaching is worse than Avery's. Plus, although he can be approached in the MSC, he seems to "look down" on you.

The other TA (AU, Cheuk Yin), however, is the reason why the teaching of this course got a D and not an E. He is very, very useful in tutorials, and his way of teaching is very easy to understand. In addition, he is highly approachable and always seems to be ready to help you.It's really easy and requires very little time to prepare for the tests.
In fact, you can get good grades simply by doing past papers and practicing some problems on the tutorial website( which is given by the teacher)no comment, I only attended one course xDNot really easy for those who didn't study M1/M2 in their secondary school.

You have to give a high effort to learn the content by yourself if you skip the lessons.Quite useful, he had prepared some notes and online learning materials for us.The content shifts to MATH1013, which is the same as 1012 with ~3 more theorems. Still tough when you failed the course last semester.Intensive course based on practical problems. It should be a lot better than theory lectures if you do not understand theories, at least you can learn from exercises.

Prof. LAM and a lot of TAs are available to solve your questions with patience.

Overall good because mathematics needs intensive and repetitive training, and it is compulsory in this course.Content is the same as Math 1013 boring as hell.
Homework: 25%
Tutorial Quizzes: 20%
Final Exam: 55%Whenever you are stuck with those hard ass questions, there are always TAs for you to ask. (Of course you can ask the professor yourself) I know I am never a smart kid and never will, but the TAs can still enable me to solve maths with detailed explanation.Just an introductory course of calculus
It covers most of differentiation but only till the beginning of integration
Integration of volume is out of syllabus.Avery a very smart teacher
He can just write forever on the blackboard
He defines the definitions very clearly.
His accent is acceptable
However, it can be quite hard to keep up with his pace because there are many things that he expects you to understand when he skips some of the steps
So i would suggest going to tutorials and MSC. It helps a lotAlthough the course are created for students who didn't take or scored below level 3 in M2 in DSE, the content is exactly the same with 1013, student who skips all lesson might find hard to follow. But it doesn't take much time and effort to score above mean in mid-term and final.Pof. Ching's teaching is one of the best I have experienced in Science School. His pronunciation is loud and clear, the speed of speech is quite fast but still easy to follow. One thing to be noticed is that he speaks "Chin-glish", which is surprisingly fine for me as it's recognizable for local students like me.Same as MATH1013 and M2 in DSE. Recommended to those who have dropped M2 in secondary school coz most of the content is just the same.Haven't gone to his lesson so no comment lolI think grading is okay la coz math1012 is to let those who havent taken m1/2 in dse so i think the grading would not be too bad. Otherwise, no difference between taking 1013 or 1012.
Final 60% Midterm 82%
A-Every math course just the same. Webwork around once a week.
Webwork same as math 1013.As the most basic and important course for a university student, this course failed to equipped students with enough knowledge about Calculus. Compared to nearby Asian universities and Ivy League universities, this course is amazingly uninformative. To be honest, the 2 week pre-Calculus course I took in the summer at my home country covers more subjects and depth of Calculus than this course. Even Math 1013 is not enough(I took a look at their final exam papers)the professor is very nice. But someone may complained about his accent and he liked to say "ummmm" from time to time.The contest is similar to what you have learnt in M1 and M2 in dse level. People without any background in M1 and M2 may find it difficult.The professor is boring. In lecture, all he talks about is proof and teaches nothing about solving maths problems. Tutorials are more useful because the tutor gives you exercises to do.The content is mainly Calculus  I. If you studied it before, you shouldn't really face too much of a problem.It felt like at times attending the lectures didn't really help out all that much as it made things a little more confusing than it really needed to be.

The tutorial on the other hand was more informative and even though it was supposed to serve as recap of what we learnt, it was much easier understanding the concepts in the tutorials than in the lectures.Compared with 1013, the theorems are mostly covered but the proof is always skipped or just tricky ones. I was enrolled in this class by mistake(kind of) and I have some calculus background so I think it's too easy.The instructor is very responsible, and the TA in my tutorial is very enthusiastic. I think they are great.Week 1 Review of the concepts of functions and graphs.  (1.2-1.3; Appendix A.)

Week 12 Definite integrals; Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  (5.2-5.3.)
Week 13 Net change; substitution rule.  (5.4-5.5.)You surely will not understand his accent. Which makes the lectures completely useless as I had a tough time just understanding what he was trying to say. E.g He will use phrases that make no sense. "your naive brains" "it is a mind-game". But he is dedicated to his work and puts in a lot of effort by writing out the notes all over the board. But you will spend time just copying down those notes and not understanding anything taught.Almost same as math1013, but some theorem excluded
take quite a lot of time to talk about function (1/3 semester)
No quiz and homework, only midterm and final exam.
Webwork 12%
Midterm 33%
Final 55%Avery is a really nice professor, notes provided on the course website.
Tutor's notes are really good, but still similar to Math 1013.This is my first as well as my last MATH course to be taken in UST. It's basically M2 stuff with a few additional theorems like the mean-value theorem and L'hôpital rule. For those who have not taken M2 it could be a little bit hard to follow, so make sure don't skip any lectures, no matter how useless you think they are. Tutorials are good opportunities to have some practice and ask more "technical" questions, and before coming to the tutorials it's necessary to clarify the concepts in lectures first.

Topics include:
Functions and their graphs;
Trigonometric functions, exponential and log functions and their inverses;
Limits, asymptotes of graphs, continuity;
Derivatives of elementary functions, product and quotient rules, chain rule.
Implicit differentiations.
Rate of changes.
Extrema of functions. The mean value theorem.
Increasing and Decreasing functions. Curve sketching.
Optimizations.
L'hôpital rule.
Riemann sums and definite integrals. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Integration by Substitution.

DSE Maths Compulsory Parts
DSE Maths Extended M2 Parts
New TopicsCHING, Avery is a very clear-minded and logical professor, and he is able to present the basic concepts very well. However, he focuses mainly on the "philosophy" of maths rather than the "technical" aspects of how to solve mathematical problems. Sometimes he just confuses us even more as he gets more in depth in his own philosophy. If you can't catch up make sure you go to the Maths Support Center and don't be afraid to raise questions.

CHAN, Yun Hung (TA), on the other way round, focuses on solving problems more than introducing and explaining concepts. He has a very bad Hong Kong accent, and many international students complained that they didn't understand. However it should be understandable for the locals. As time is limited he often teaches VERY fast in the lectures. Make sure you really take out a piece of paper and a pen to have a try solving the problem, but not just sit there looking as he writes. Practice determines your grade.Avery is a good teacher who always tries to explain the concepts as clearly as possible. He delivers a good presentation with logical thinking.

For me the only thing to criticise is that his teaches this class.Very difficult course

- Limit of Functions
- Continuity
- DifferentiabilityInstructors upload video!
He is quite good teacher, his lecture note is reasonable to understand.Before midterm:
- countability
- inf, sup
- limits of sequence

After midterm:
- Cauchy sequences
- limits of function
- intermediate value theorem
- mean value theorem, Taylor's theorem
- Riemann integral

This is an unorthodox analysis course because the theorems and techniques taught are specific to the exam question types, which are largely fixed. One still won't be able to work out most of the problems and proofs on an analysis book after finishing this course.Never went to the lectures. His notes look concise.

The tutorials by Hugo were quite good. He is able to explain things clearly and is quite passionate in teaching.https://www.math.ust.hk/~makyli/UG.html
This is the website for this course and some others taught by Dr. Li.In detail. But almost read from notes. There are hand-written transparencies and old lecture notes. I think the lecture notes covered almost all the contents in transparencies.1. Vector-valued functions: limit, differentiation, inverse function theorem, implicit function theorem
The following is not related to vector-valued functions, i.e. only single variable functions are discussed.
2. Sequences and series of functions: limit superior/inferior, pointwise convergence, taylor series, uniform convergence (continuity/integration/differentiation theorem, L-Test, Weierstrass M-Test, Dini's Theorem, Abel's Limit Theorem)
Emphasis is put on uniform convergence.
3. Set operations, images and inverse images
Content of this part is short, but quite important for later studies.
4. Lebesgue measure and integration on the real line: 5 steps: study of sets; measurable sets; measurable functions; Lebesgue integral and its properties; convergence theorems
The hardest part of this course. I find measurable sets and measurable functions quite hard to deal with.
Note that in this course you are not required to understand the proofs of the theorems but to apply the theorems.Kin Li is good at teaching and patient at answering questions.
I find it quite funny that he prepares a hard final exam and a strict grading scheme to kill us, while he tries out his way to save us by teaching as much as possible to handle the final exam.
Though the notes are clear and complete, it is better to go for class to catch up with the progress.
Henry is an excellent TA for his delivery and well-prepared notes.Typical Analysis topics.  
First half of the semester too easy and standard
After midterm starts to be more difficultHugo teaches very well.  Going to his tutorial is good enough for this course, but need to do a lot of problems provided by him. Remember to attend his tutorial, he recognizes people's face and names.

Lecture: Notes can be downloaded from Kin Li's website.  Lecture videos are provided.1. functions of several variables (differentiability, implicit & inverse function theorems)
2. uniform convergence
3. measure theory, Lebesgue integral

The third part is very abstract and extremely hard. There was simply not enough time for us to really grasp this part (hence the very low mean 3x/100 in final). Very little exercises and examples on these topics.Handwritten notes. Quite concise and to the point.Quite hard... This is due to the math curriculum problem.Ok la... he is quite caring. Just simply ask him in office hours and he will be very kind to teach you anything. He will always answer students answer through email if you are polite. Quite a nice teacher but sometimes quite boring...xdFunctions of several variables, implicit and inverse function theorem, uniform convergence measure and integral on the real line.Quite good. Although I skipped lesson most of the time, I still think Prof. Kin Li is a good lecturer. His "teaching speed" is adequate. He is good at teaching student abstract mathematical concept.Inverse function theorem
Implicit function theorem
Uniform Convergence
Lebesgue Measure & Integration
open, closed or compact sets
LDCT
Simple functionThe notes is clearly written and large amount of example is given.
The lecture is quite boring.
Presentations are not helpful on learning.
Prof. Kin Li is very patient in answering questions.1. Vector-Valued Functions:

2. Uniform Convergence:

3. Lebesgue Measure & Integration:Kin Li is a good professor. He is patient in answering your question.1. Vector-Valued Functions:
It is relatively easy compared to other 2 parts. You just need to memorize 1) how to prove differentiability of vector-valued functions and 2) inverse / implicit function theorem

2. Uniform Convergence:
The concept itself is quite hard to grasp at first, since it can be quite tricky to differentiate uniform and pointwise convergence at first. But, once you grasp the concept, you just have to memorize theorems such as M-Test and it won't be quite hard to deal with exam problems.

3. Lebesgue Measure & Integration (BOSS DIFFICULTY):
This is probably the most challenging concept I had to deal with in my entire academic history. There are many theorems and properties you have to memorize, and it's really hard to grasp the concept of "measure" (since it is really abstract) and Lebesgue integration. The finals are basically a test on this part, so... yeah. Good luck with this (you will need it).Kin Li is really great at explaining the content, despite the fact that the concepts are really hard for the students to grasp. In that sense, his teaching skills are great. He understands the intellectual level of most students in the class, and tries to teach the course from that point of view.Please see attached requirements.The prof does not really care about this course. There are no notes. Only refer to a textbook mentioned in the syllabus. Also, the prof's spoken English is not good according to me and it's hard to follow. So later I didn't go to class and only read the textbook.I personally really liked the content of the course.
Mainly decided into 3 parts:
1. Basic Math Revision (Sets, Relations, Functions, Binary Operations, Complex Numbers)
2. Group Theory (Groups, Subgroups, Cyclic Groups, Permutations, Lagrange Theorem, Homomorphisms, Factor Groups, Group Action)
3. Ring Theory (Rings, Fields, Integral Domains, Fermat's Theorems)His teaching is pretty boring. There are no slides so you would have to go to class to get his notes. But, his notes are very similar to the book and you can find most of the examples he uses in class there.

However, I found it helpful to hear his explanations. Just helps revise concepts and important theorems for the exams.Teaching schedule
before midterm1
-financial math
-matrices

before midterm2
-differentiation

before final
integration

This course covers basic calculus. Content is not very difficult (if you work hard) but teaching pace is fast. Constant effort is needed to catch up. Every topics are covered in HKDSE. You life are easier if you have learnt it before.Professor Xiong
At the beginning, he just read out everything from the powerpoint. Attending lessons doesn't help much. It is the same if you read it yourself. But after midterm1, he conducted class survey and there are apparent changes in teaching method. Instead of reading powerpoint,he writes everything step by step on the whiteboard and makes it easier to follow. His teaching and accent aren't really good but I would say he do care about our feelings and learning.

TA Kitty
She is quite nice and willing to teach you. She prepares her own notes in tutorials. Many exercises are included in tutorials and it do help. Basically if you don't go to lecture and just read the textbook yourself and attend tutorials, you can still perform good in exam.It is super similar to DSE M2 syllabus so it is not very hard.The professor teaches very well, he explained the concepts clearly but the course content is not that difficult so if you can understand the PPT slides and can finish the exercise given by your own. Then skipping the lessons is not a problem.

The professor is also willing to help if you come to his office or find him after lecture.The course includes financial math,matrix, derivatives and anti-derivatives. All of them are very basic contents.The professor is very nice and most of class time is doing example questions. If you focus a lot during the class time, you will find the content very easy.10% Web work: finish on time
50% midterm: 2 midterms with a middle difficulty
40% final: seems to be more difficult than midterms, so please do more practices and do not be nervous.If you review the material and do example questions on time, you can do really well. (light workload)The powerpoint is clear, shows the concepts and steps. Revision can be done by just learning from the powerpoint. However, some solutions of the problems are solved in classes. If you do not attend the classes, you may miss some solutions.The professor just reads from the powerpoint, not really useful teaching. The class is a little bit noisy.The course covers mathematics for finance (some concepts like present value, future value and annuity etc.), matrix, differentiation and integration. As most of the students taking this course are business students, the syllabus also covers some applications of the mathematical concepts, like two-industries models and marginal analysis in economics. The content in this course can hence be applied in other business core courses, for example, I found the mathematics for finance particularly useful in accounting course, which covers the computation of bonds' present value.

Although some examples covered in differentiation and integration require the use of calculators, Mid-term 2 (just testing differentiation) and Final Exam (testing differentiation and integration) mainly examine your ability to apply the concepts taught. Those questions do not appear in these exams, hence no calculators are allowed.Prof. Li will do some proof and steps on the white board for some difficult mathematical concepts and examples in class, so that we can have more thorough understanding about the content. However, he is not always able to make verbal explanations of the concepts clearly. If you have no idea about what he is talking about, referring to the white board might be a good choice for you.

TA is Kitty. She makes her own tutorial notes, including some crucial formulas and concepts for each topic, followed by a lot of exercises. The tutorial notes are pretty useful and she will put the solution of the exercises on her own webpage. She will also go through some questions to clear our misunderstandings. In spite of her low voice which makes the tutorials a bit boring, I still think that attending the tutorials is beneficial to you.Financial math. (Future and present value )
Matrix
Derivatives
Integration
(With some application problems)
Generally more basic conceptsDepend on your professors, some of their lessons are really difficult to understand
While some tutorial sessions can help understand concepts-Discounting and Compounding:

-Matrix
-Calculuspoor teaching.
The tutor just read through the slides.Quite good as long as you have done all the textbook exercises. The exercises are important for you to gain a better understanding of the concepts.
This course is not in absolute grading so you do not need to worry. Actually, the mean will be very low because most of the students did not do much revision on it.There is homework every week. The questions are easy and they are useful for your preparation for the midterms and final exams.It is not very hard as long as you attended all the lesson and do some exercises. But it is also ok if you skip all the lesson and study by yourself haha. The most important thing is still doing enough practice.Fair teaching. But most of the time she only read through the power point. However, you cannot find the answer to the exercise in the power point cuz she sometimes only shows it during class.Covers topics such as finances, matrices, derivatives and integration.

Finances is basically calculating interest rates and bank payments (taught in core maths in high school as well). I heard the level of matrices covered in this class is much easier than that taught in extended maths for DSE.

Derivatives and integration is a little more difficult for those who have weaker math background, but the level of difficulty covered for these topics is bearable as long as you work hard and study. The content is extremely useful in studying business in the future years, so I guess the content is still pretty good.Weiping is extremely cute (I think). He is extremely nice and tries to crack jokes even though not many people laugh. I still remember him joking about his finger being lazy because the projector did not respond to him. Anyways, Weiping is extremely patient and does not mind staying after class to answer students' questions. The TAs are also very nice and patient. I didn't quite like the tutor I was assigned, so I just went to another tutorial with a chubby TA. He was amazing! I forgot his name, but you can find him in the Math Support Centre.Mathematics of Finance
Systems of Linear Equations; Matrices
Limits and the Derivative
Additional Derivative Topics
Graphing and Optimization
Integration
Additional Integration Topics

Those are basic topics of calculus and linear algebra.Acceptable.
Step by step to show you how to do the calculations.
He is nice and willing to answer your question.
Attending the class can help you understand more, but many skip the classes.The first two chapters are quite easy about matrix and equations.
and the calculus part much more difficult to understandHe really explains things quite clearly with a lot of examples, really quite easy to followDun worry hard work pays off!! I have done all the exercise in the book of all the chapter taught and I performed quite well in the exam. Also there are several sets of past paper provided, so you must do it to familiar with the type of questions. but calculators are not allowed in this course. the mean of mid term is quite high, but the mean for final is quite low less than a half of the total mark.You have to finish the webwork. Those questions are more difficult to the examination. However, you must know how to do those webwork questions to get a gd grade. If you dun know how to do so, simply go to math support centre.The course touches upon concepts of matrix, differentiation and interest rate, etc. which are not too hard, or may even be easy, to most students.The instructor is humorous and makes some funny jokes in the lesson. He teaches very clearly and I can understand most, if not all, of the concepts. He is also flexible and does not rely solely on the powerpoints - he gives alternative solutions during certain points of the lesson. Nice instructor!The content of the lecture is relatively easy for freshmen. Some basic knowledge of calculus will be taught.The professor is a really nice person. It is very kind of her to help me out of some problems I met in the exam. There will be a series of powerpoint for each class.Teaches basic mathematical concepts, as the lowest math level course.
Topics include:
Financial math
Matrixs
Calculus with differentiation and integrationWang Ke is very careful and detailed which can be boring at times but really helps when understanding more complicated concepts.
Lecture slides are shared on canvas and explain the formulas with examples. In class she will go through the slides adding explanations then go through many examples with you. She will had write the steps and project it onto the screen for students to follow.No CommentQuite boring.
She just read from ppt and her accent makes me hard to understand at the beginning.
The examples given in lesson are easy to understand and quite similar to the exam questions.
The best thing about the lesson is she would solve the problem step by step and the pace is slow, which give me more time to figure out what’s happening.It's ok if you've done IB. Otherwise, GG. :)
First half of semester: interest and matrices.
Second half of semester: differentiation and integration.Li Weiping tries very hard to make you understand the subject, and to arouse your interest in maths. Not bad given that he knows (and you know) that you're probably never gonna take maths again.

Li Xilin just goes through the worksheets and goes through what Li Weiping covers in class. Decent.The course mainly covers four sections: Matrices, Financial Mathematics, Differentiation and Integration. The Mid-term Exam covers the former two topics; where Finals covers the latter two topics excluding any syllabus covered in the Mid-term examination.
The content is pretty easy for newbies in calculus and statistics: The financial maths covers a couple of formulas that are not too complicated. However, all the content requires a lot of practices to master the steps and treatments for different question types.Not really having a lot of comments on the teaching skills of the lecturer, all I could say is the accent... is pretty hard to follow. The tutor in tutorial sessions is pretty good in terms of explaining the practice questions to us.This course teaches basic calculus.  Professor Li plan the time well.  All the materials are covered in a suitable speed.  Answer students' questions in a very detailed way.  Sometimes I think it is too detail and uses too much time.  But I admit that every student has different ability so I really appreciate his patience and willingness to teach.Professor Li is a wonderful professor.  Willing to spend his spare time after lessons answering questions, replies email quickly, gives a lot of reminders before mid-term and final exam.  Maths really requires students to do a lot of practice.  Professor Li mentioned this again and again.  He also provided us some recommended questions.  Those questions save our time finding suitable practice.  2 past papers are provided before mid term and final respectively.  Overall a wonderful professor.Interest, Matrix, Infinity, Derivatives (Heavy)Speed of teaching is fine but still need to pay attention in class to catch up
His English is understandable
Includes applications in slides to explain
Tho he only read out the ppt
TA is bad he doesn't know what he is talking about either
Can't understand the TA's EnglishThis is, perhaps, the easiest maths course in HKUST. The content is rather easy and just a constant review will do. Webwork will also help. Try to finish webwork by yourself so that you can really learn.The teacher may not cover anything in an in-depth way. And the teacher just directly referred to the notes without further explain how the calculation is done. Yet, students may turn to their tutors for help and they are willing to show how it is done.Cover simpler topics such as present value, future value and matrix before the mid term exam.
Cover advanced topics such as derivatives and integration after the mid term exam.
Topics before mid term exam is much more easier to understand whereas topics after that are quite difficult for students that who have never studied similar topics.Professor Xiong uses a quite flat tone and follows mainly the examples in the slides. He sometimes show us the calculation step by step on the projector in some advanced topics.-Mathematics of Finance
-Systems of Linear Equations; Matrices
-Limits and the Derivative
-Additional Derivative Topics
-Graphing and Optimization
-Integration
-Additional Integration TopicsThe professor just read the content on her powerpoint. It was quite unnecessary to attend all the lectures, but I recommend you to learn the graphing by attending the class.
The professor was willing to answer your questions after class and the explanation was clear.I dropped M2 when I was F.5 and many of the topics taught in this course are covered in HKDSE M2, including differentiation and integration (these topics are taught after midterm), I think that the content here is more straightforward than that of M2 and it was quite easy to follow though I thought that I would screw up as I experienced failure in my M2. The geometric sequence and matrix taught before midterm will be fine if u do enough exercises.It is hard for a math teacher not to read allow the ppt when teaching, so I think her teaching is fine because she explained the concepts clearly though the teaching pace is quite fast. Sometimes she provides detailed steps or notes which are not shown on the ppt and those notes are quite useful. The TA is also good and is willing to answer questions but the tutorial's pace is much slower so if u have already understood the concepts in lectures u may not need to attend the tutorials. No attendance required for both lecture and tutorial.Interest(present/future value,annuity), matrics, calculus(limit, differentiation and integration)Weiping teaches well. Usually, there are very few steps in the lecture notes so it is hard for students to solve by themselves. However, he explains each question in the lecture notes on the board. So students can easily follow and do revision after class. He is passionate and willing to answer questions from students. Occasionally tell some jokes in the class and encourage students to do more exercise. The atmosphere in the class is also good, the majority of students pay attention to his lecture and jot notes (some take pictures). But his class is at 9 am, so not many students will attend the lecture.
Especially recommend this prof to those who are not good at maths and aim high in this course.I Chapter 3. Mathematics of Finance (3.1-3.4) I Chapter 4.

Go to his lectures on time.If you have questions, just go to ask him by email or meet him in person. He is willing to answer patiently. P.S. I nearly sent over 20 emails to ask him during final exam period.

Tutorials can actually skipped if you really pay attention in lecture. My tutor is Liu Ping which is a very kind big boy. But professor teaching is much better, so I usually find Prof. Li.Financial Math
Matrix
CalculusTeaching is bad, the lecturer only reads powerpoints.
There is no reason to attend the class if you are good at math.
Read powerpoints are enough for you to understand what is happening.

Attending tutorial is recommended, as a revision of syllabus and actually could get answer of the WEBWORK as well.
Those tutors are quite qualified.Interest rates, matrices, differentiation and integration topics. This course is for local students who haven't studied M1/M2 in the DSE curriculum and non-local students who haven't studied differentiation and integration in high school, so its crucial to have the initiative to do the exercises in the textbook, or else you'll have a hard time in the mid-term and final.Prof. Li was quite a nice professor; he would encourage us to ask questions whenever we had any problems. He would also crack jokes occasionally and write things on the whiteboard to motivate us. However, the response from the students was rather subdued, maybe because it was a 9am lesson.Before midterm:
Financial Maths (Present & Future Value of an Annuity)
Matrices (including inverse, gauss-jordan elimination and leontief input-output analysis)

After midterm:
Calculus:
- Limits and continuity
- Basic differentiation
- Chain rule and implicit differentiation
- Curve sketching; absolute maxima and minima
- Optimization
- Integration: by substitution, indefinite and definite integrals, area under curves (Riemann sums)
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- Integration by partsJust reading the ppt slides, very easy to fall asleep
However she explains the steps in solving problems quite in detail and clear
The TA is quite useful in teaching actual problem-solving skills and he explains complicated concepts quite okayThis course covers financial maths, matrices, and calculus (differentiation and integration). Very basic. Unless you are a business student (I think its compulsory for them), I would recommend you to take pure calculus courses like Calculus 1.The teacher is very good, but mostly reads from the ppt. She is quite helpful after class from what I heard, I personally have never contacted her for any doubts.He explains each sample questions step by step.
Sometimes also explains the online questions.Boring if you know the content. You can study yourself. It is okay to use phone and laptop as long as you don't disturb him.Absolute Grading.
Easy to get an A in this course if you know all the concept and do the online questions.Normal workload. Around 1 assignments per 1.5 weeks. ~10 questions and only the last two or three is a little bit difficult. But you can ask the TA at Maths Center. It also counts into the grade of the course.differentiaton+matrix+integration+financial mathsFirst Half:
- Financial Mathematics (Present Value, Future Value, FV and PV of an Annuity etc.)
- Systems of Linear Algebra
- Matrices
- Functions and Graphs

Second Half:
- Derivatives
- Optimization
- Integration
//+ any other basic concepts within these.The professors are generally okay and use powerpoints to teach. These powerpoints are important to look over after class. The classes are quite large, so aim to sit nearer to the front where you'll be able to ask questions.

I would advise you to attend all of the tutorial sessions, which I find useful, as it can help understand the mathematics concepts more.it is a complusory course. it will be no big deal if you try to get help from your friends who are familiar with M1 or M2 mathsShe is a new instructor. Her lessons are quite boring, but she is kind of helping students after classes.Actually, it depends on your classmates. But most likely, it will not be a big deal even if you start revision just few days before.regular webwork, most of the questions are easier than textbook. Get help from MSC(math support center)The course covers financial maths, matrices, and calculus (differentiation and integration). Content covered by all professors is the same.Professor Wang is super nice and approachable. She just teaches based off powerpoint slides, just like all the other teachers. I found her teaching speed a bit fast, but probably all the professors are like that too, so nothing against her. She doesn't take attendance, so a lot of people didn't bother showing up, but I found class useful because she provides additional tips and working on top of what is illustrated on the powerpoint slides.It covers the calculation of interests, matrix, limits and derivation. Not difficult. Just follow the powerpoint and do it step by step.Her voice is quite small and her pronunciation is sometimes not clear. She only reads out what is said on powerpoint so actually it is not a must to attend her lecture.Quite good. I was above mean for more than 1 sd in the 2 midterms and above mean 0.5 sd for the final exam. Although I score a zero in one of the webwork assignments since I forgot to do it, I got an A in overall.The workload is light. You are required to finish no more than 10 webwork assignments. No quiz during class for WANG, Ke.Actually the content will not vary a lot from other professors. However, his explanation is clear and easy to understand for those who have not touched extended module (M1 or M2) in DSE.Some of my friends said that his english is not that good to understand. However, as long as you have adapt the way he speak, his explanation and teaching is so good to understand.If you have studied mathematics extended module in your secondary school, this course will be easy for you as most of the content are the same or even easier than m2.Weiping's teaching is clear enough for me to understand. He shows every steps in detail in order to make sure everyone of us understand.Webwork
overall okaymostly about M1 , have a few about M2, if you learnt M1 before, you will have advantage.just simply read out from the powerpoint, but quite good as she will teach every questions step by step from the pp. some students think her speaking accent not good, but i can accept it. She is very nice and can ask her questions after class.Midterm 1
interest (Future value of an annuity,present value of an annuity)

integration (integration by parts, integration by substitution)professor taught according to her powerpoint. Steps are clearly presented on powerpoins. But she would provide extra examples to illustrate in class. She is kind, nice and willing to answer questions from student. Attendence are not taken .The start of the semester was on Linear Algebra including things most people should have learned in high school like matrices etc. After the first midterm we began to learn more about derivatives and antiderivatives.http://Ms.Wang teaches at an average to slightly fast pace. Sometimes she glosses over steps such as simplification of equations which might be confusing if you're not paying attention. But she will always clarify if you raise your hand and ask her so don't hesitate. She will also take time after class to help you if you need extra assitance. I spent some time at her office before midterms and the final exam and she was very patient and helpful. She does her best to make sure all her students are prepared for the exams and is always willing to help anyone who seeks it.Chapters are related and it is quite helpful for business students. It could be challenging for some students but it is not hard if you attend class.The professor reads off from the power point. Provides extra problems that students can practice. She is nice and kind, always willing to answer extra questions or help.I think you basically learn the exact same thing no matter who is your instructor.  They actaully use the same powerpoint in teaching.  The things they taught are same basic concepts of how maths can apply on economic issues as well, which I found them quite interesting and useful.The teaching is kind of useless I would say.  The instructor spoke too soft and always make mistakes while explaining.  Sometimes she didn't even realised she was wrong until some student reminded her.  But I personally think you don't need a good instructor to ace this subject, you just need to read through all PowerPoint, excercise and homework is good enough.  Or find someone good at maths to carry you.The content is fine as it is not too difficult to pick up. But there is really so much things to learn and sometimes will mess them up.Teaching is not good as she will just repeat the lecture notes once without making theories and calculation easier. She always does some questions again which are actually included in lecture notes in the lecture. It is quite time-consuming and meaningless.Chapter 3. Mathematics of Finance (3.1-3.4)
Chapter 4. Systems of Linear Equations; Matrices (4.1-4.7)
Chapter 10. Limits and the Derivative (10.4-10.5)
Chapter 11. Additional Derivative Topics (11.1-11.6)
Chapter 12. Graphing and Optimization (12.1-12.2, 12.4-12.6)
Chapter 13. Integration (13.1-13.2, 13.4-13.5)
Chapter 14. Additional Integration Topics (14.1-14.3)She is super nice and willing to answer your questions after class. You can also send her email to ask anything and she replies quickly. However, the examples provided during lectures are not adequate, tutorials are useful for further practices.Only few topics are included (Present and future value, Matrix, Differentiation, Integration), but it is rather difficult to learn all these topics in such a short period of time.Just reading the powerpoint.Three key topics:
1) Financial Math (L1-L4)
2) Basic Matrix (L5- L12)
(fist mid-term coverage)

3) Basic Calculus,
including limit, differentiation: (second mid-term coverage)
integration
(final exam only covers calculus items)

The content will be covered in the first mid-term test is quite easy, so basically you can read the note all by your own.
However, once the calculus part started, I think it is better for you to start to catch up all the stuff asap.
Normally speaking, students who would take this course should have no idea with calculus. However, the teaching speed of this course is quite fast. I recommend that you may borrow a M1 book from your friends to do some exercises in order to get a better grade!Erm...
I think her teaching is fair, but not quite satisfactory.
Basically just read out the note, and copy those steps listed on the notes in the whiteboard ...
But I do think she is willing to help students and she answers  email efficiently!As a person who never learned Calculus before, the lecture contents were very enlightening - this lecture taught me why business students should learn calculus.  Besides calculus, the financial math part was also very interesting to me because the contents were very practical and useful.The professor is very nice, she is very eager to help her students improve their math skills. However, I think she lacks of charisma as a professor, so the fellow students did not really pay much attention to her lecture.

TA: Leung Ho Ming
Not sure of what other TAs did, but he used a 'spoon-feeding' method to teach his students. It might sound negative, but I am pretty sure that this teaching method is better for people who never learned the contents before.- Financial math
- Matrices
- Diffrentiation and integration

Found Financial math rather challenging.
The matrices taught was basic. But it takes some time to get the idea. But if you did IGCSE math, I remember touching on it.
Did IB Math SL so differentiation and integration was an ok topic for me.In the beginning, he constantly read off powerpoints. Really didn't like that. He was aware that students were unhappy so he made changes to his teaching style. Overall I would say he's teacher who cares about his students but I personally didn't really respond well to his teaching style. I guess it depends on you. Generally, I felt the tutorials were more helpful. Not everyone would agree but I suggest finding what fits you best.

He uploads powerpoints and question on his website. But I prefer doing the recommended questions from the textbook and the tutorial exercises.- Financial mathematics like future and present values
- matrix
- derivatives
- integration
and some application problems

Some of these topics are covered in hkdse mathematics module I or II.  This course gives u a basic concept or understanding on calculusWeiping's teaching is fair. He has lecture notes and he will sometime copy the steps or do the questions on his own on the board. He will explain it briefly but sometime it is hard to understand and follow him up, which means you may have to self study it.

For the TA Kitty, she prepared some tutorial notes that are quite practical and useful, in which you can treat that as some additional practices before the mid terms and exams.

Tips: remember to do the questions in the textbooks or webwork, as I saw the same question appeared in the mid terms.Financial math. (Future and present value )
Matrix
Derivatives
Integration
(With some application problems)
Generally more basic conceptsExtremely difficult to follow along to his lectures, dont learn much and he makes a lot of mistakes  on the whiteboard which his students tend to correct him on. TA is not much help eitherI had the first few lessons so far. The first three lessons are talk about how to calculate interest rate, which is quiet easy. But I don't know what will be teach later.She just follow up the ppt and repeat it once. And the explanation is not clear. I really cannot hear what she says.No CommentThere are some textbook exercises but it is not mandatory. You can choose to do it or not. Also, there are online homework which affect the grades. So you must need to do it.
So far I think the workload is really low.In fact, the basic content for this course is quite useful on business studies, especially for those who have never learnt about calculus. They can all be applied to solve some economical problems.He should be a smart mathematics expert but not a good teacher. He just keeps on focusing on his teaching materials but never consider about students' learning progress. Moreover, he always calculates wrongly and only notice the problem until some students remind him.Course contents are finance/business related mathematics and basic calculus. Generally very easy.English was a bit difficult to follow at times. The instructor shows all computations on the projector as he does examples by hand, which is fantastic.Grading is fair. Be wary though that the midterm mark actually matters too. The quizzes in class are an easy way to slightly increase your grade, but they won't save you if you screw up everything else.Webwork is not too difficult and the course does not require much work IF you have any past experience in calculus. The business/finance mathematics part requires a lot of memorization of formulas, I think even more so than the calculus part.This course covers some fundamental calculus topics, such as differentiation,integration and matrix.Sometimes Hai may not be able to present his ideas fluently when he discussed the relative topic and explained questions from other http://students.It may be difficult for foreign students to understand the idea he wants to present. However, Hai is able to explain the content in Putonghua so it is an advantage for Mainland students.Very simple maths. A lot of contents are repeating your high school's content. Just very little new knowledge is taught.Actually he was just reading the powerpoint. But the tutor is very nice. When you ask her question, she will answer you very quickly, and clearly.Good grading, if you have your revision done. The homework are very easy, and you can try tons of time. You can also use online calculator. The mis-term exam, and final exam are very similar to the past paper, just some changes in the number.Very light workload, just some webwork, and regular quiz. Each quiz only contain 1-2 simple question. And you can ask the previous lecture student and get the question.Personal finance, simple matrices, basic calculus.
I have taken M1 in hkdse but I got a level so I ended up in 1003 and it is quite easy for me to catch up.A bit hard to understand the professor but it doesn't matter. Basically study the lecture notes, do some exercise and you can get A already.I skipped all lessons, showed up in every single quizzes and midterms, finished all webworks, above mean 1 sd in final and i got A-.Only weekly webwork, around 10 questions, it is not too challenging and good for revision.If you have learned M1/M2 in high school, this course will be easy for you as the main contents of the course are differentiation and integration. Quite useful for other business courses like econ.The professor is really nice. Although his lessons are quite boring, he is willing to help if you ask him questions after lesson. The powerpoints are useful.basic financial mathematics, matrix ,differentiation, integration
just like M2 in high school.
Not difficult, and exam is quite stright -forward
there are few past papers provided for you.
So no worryHe is an nice professor who are pleased to teach you when you have problems. But his teaching is quite boring.Basic maths including financial maths, matrices, calculusNothing to say at all, he just read out the powerpoint and sometimes copy it once.

He once explained a math question with the following sentence: why I do it like this? It is by experience... Well, I know practice make perfect, but saying this will be somehow strange.

Some calculation mistakes from time to time.

But to be fair, he is helpful, try to ask him by email, his spoken English is not really good.

For tutorial, TA is Partrick, he is able to explain what you need to know for exams, good presentation techniques. For locals, you may ask him in Cantonese after class. Never miss his tutorial, he has his own notes which are useful.Most easiest course in UST and the content is easy to understand if you do all the things seriously...Well, I must say that most of the prof in this course cannot explain the concept well...so...it seems to have no difference among different prof and it's even better for you to read and understand the books and slides instead of listening to the prof in the lectures...MATH1003 is the easiest mathematics course in UST.

It consist four major parts - Financial Mathematics, Matrices, Differential and Integration.

For 2015/16 Fall, midterm 1 would be financial + matrices. Midterm 2 would be differentiation while final will focus more on integration but there are some questions from previous parts since it is cumulative.

Financial Mathematics and Matrices are easy. Pay attention in class and do sufficient practices will help in midterm. Differentiation and Integration would be more difficult especially for people who never learn it before. It requires some basic understanding of limits (urghhh I never understand it) to do well but you can keep doing those textbook practices until you are familiar with the questions.

And yes, some webwork questions were super hard but I asked my seniors to solve it lol. Sometimes you can solve it by using online calculators (eg mathway).

Textbook is useful. Get one and do the exercises.Prof. Xiong is a good professor. You can feel that he cares about the students. I think all math1003 prof are really nice so it's the same no matter you're in which class. However, I always slept in his class so...

I only attended my tutorial once because the TA speaks with a strong Hong Kong accent and the class is too early lol.math course for business students
financial mathematics and differentiation and integration.

you may need differentiation for econ course and  some financial model so it is quite usefulhe always told students to stop by his office to get help from him once you don't understand the problems.

and the notes made by my tutor are quite useful because they summarized the key points of every chapterFinanicial mathematics: simple & compund interest, mortage, amortization

Linear algebra: basic and as simple as 3x3 opertaion

Calculus: no sin cos calculus, similar to M1 calculus, differentions and integrationGood teacher
He is good at explaning concept and willing to answer questions.
Lots of example in class and those are quite similar to examsI am interested in the content before midterm, but the part about inequality and policy is hard.  Education part is not easy as wellNice professor with passionate teaching
Detailed explanationGood grade i would say
midterm: above mean 1 sd
Final: above less than 1sd
Essay: around mean
final grade: A-acceptable level of workload
but readings are boring, but if u fully understand the content in the class, it is not necessary to waste time for reading, but do memorize those points on the PPT and she repeated over and over againIt typically cover the main parts of the required contents. Some are beyond required.The teacher's English is kind of hard to understand. Sometimes she liked to repeat a phrase for several times which makes us hard to understand what she want to say.The content of this course are easy to understand and is suitable for undergraduates who did not take any calculus course before. Things like differentiation and integration would appear in the course but they were not being to go very deep.The professor used a lot of examples to illustrate difficult concepts and she provided many resources such as past paper examinations and mini-lecture questions to us in order to let us have a better understanding of mathematics. Tutorial sections were also provided.financial math, matrix, differentiation, integration etc

financial math and matrix for mid term 1 only
differentiation integration for mid term 2 and finals

there are around 30 power points in total with a lot of practice exercises and examplesi did attend most of professor xiong's lectures but i only attend few math tutorials (kitty)

prof xiong usually explains the examples in the power points and sometimes gives us time to do practice questions on our own and then give further explanation. however i think the pace of the lecture is a bit too fast for calculus beginners without m1 or m2 in their previous studies

for math tutorial, i think that kitty teaches really fast and i could not catch up with what she is talking about so i recommend skipping kitty's math tutorial and sit the tutorials of other TAs.Math 1003 is not that difficult to some students. If you are good enough, you can easily understand the content of this course.It is a little bit hard to understand what Professor Li is saying. But if you can follow what he is writing, then you can understand most of it. Just try your best to understand him. BTW, he doesn't take attendance, it is quite good.Three main parts:

1. Wave equation, diffusion equation
2. Boundary value problems (separation of variables) and Fourier series
3. Harmonic functions, Green's functions

The first part and second part are very easy, particularly if you have taken an ODE course before. The third part may appear a bit intimidating at first but the tools are actually quite similar.Can't say because I never went to class! He seems nice though.Basic problems in PDE, boudary problems etc. May be useful for physics students.Prof Wang likes to write on his iPad, and his handwriting is hard to recognize, his teaching basically follows the textbook, so no need to attend the lectures.40% Homework, 60% Final exam.
The TA Wei Xiaoyu is very nice, he said you would get full homework mark only by handing in the homework on time.
The difficulty degree and form of final exam is similar to homework, if you do homework by yourself it's easy to get high mark.One homework per week, easy to find answers online.Mainly divided into 2 parts : Probability and Statistics.
Probability part is bearable... Statistics part is boring and difficult to visualise.Don't take this course if he's teaching. Lecture notes are badly written. No slides used. Notes released for every class after the class. No numerical example in the notes (Ya right and he called it a statistics class!)Probability, sets, RVs, expectations, descriptive stats, statistics, point estimators, hypothesis testing, and linear regressionThe umm teaching is uhh by far the bestuh part of the course. I have uhhhh taken a umm class with Avery before, and uhhh I have finally gotten accustomed to uhm uhh uhhh his uhh methods of uhm instruction.

The uhh key is to ummm focus very closely on uhhhh what he says in class. Not just uhhh on uhhh what's already uhh on the given lecture notes, but umm every single "uh" or "um" he says. With uhhh each "uh" comes a uhhh complex combination of ummm emotion and uhhh uhh um ... meaning behind all those theorems and uhh proofs he writes on the board. Understanding these uhs is uhhh crucial to scoring well on the exams.Chapter 1-3 is about probability
Chapter 4-9 is about statistics
Chapter 4 is where you should focus most of your energy in because other chapters (5-9) are all easy to understand once you get the hang of chapter 4.The lecturer is pretty nice and the slides are funny with some anime jokes connecting to the statistics field. I found it funny but the slides are pretty hard to understand.
He goes through the slides of each chapter and when he finishes, he goes through problems for that chapter.Introductory statistics course with little emphasis on proof.
0. Introduction to Statistics
1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Probability
3. Random Variables
4. Estimation
5. Hypothesis Testing
6. Simple Linear Regression
7. Confidence Interval and Hypothesis Testing
8. ANOVA models
9. Distribution FittingThe instructor is friendly and approachable. You can ask him questions after the class ends or during office hour. He will briefly review concepts taught previously at the beginning of lesson. He also goes through review questions step by step to let us know how to "apply" statistics to solve problems.
Skipped most of the tutorials so no comment for TA.the content before mt is really easy, about probability
after that, it got harder.
but its great that we can get  a cheat sheet in final. so, we just need to sub numbers into the formula to get the answer (of course, you have to understand the formula first)prof is really nice
he explained examples in details and step by step
easy to follow
and he is funny!!Chapter 0:Introduction to Statistics
Chapter 1:Descriptive Statistics
Chapter 2:Probability
Chapter 3:Random Variables
Chapter 4:Confidence Interval maybe? (i forgot lol
Chapter 5:Simple Linear Regression
Chapter 6:Hypothesis Testing maybe? (i really forgot  
Chapter 7:Confidence Interval and Hypothesis Testing
Chapter 8:ANOVA models
Chapter 9:Distribution FittingDr. Yu is a very good professor. He is the most patient teacher I have met in my life probably. Sometimes when I come up with some stupid ideas and ask him about that, he never scolds me for wasting his time.

His lecture notes are very creative and informative. Even you skip some of his lectures you can still catch up by self-studying. Though I suggest attending all the classes. :)The following is the flow of the course:
Chapter 0 Introduction to Statistics
Chapter 1 Descriptive Statistics
Chapter 2 Probability
Chapter 3 Random Variables
Chapter 4 Estimation
Chapter 5 Hypothesis Testing
Chapter 6 Simple Linear Regression
Chapter 7 Confidence Interval and Hypothesis Testing for Two-sample Problems
Chapter 8 ANOVA Model
Chapter 9 Goodness of Fit Test

There is also review questions and problem sets for some chapters.His teaching before the midterm was alright.. Perhaps the content is not difficult to most of the students. However, the nightmare started when he taught hypothesis testing, which is the main topic throughout the course. Basically he is not teaching but just self-talking, in the sense that he simply does not care how you understand the course. What I do feel is he just wants to finish the schedule on time.

His pronunciation is another tragedy. He carried extremely heavy Cantonese accent.. Also in the period after midterm, he project

If you find you can't follow him on lectures, that's normal and the advice is don't go to class anymore until you have self-studied the materials, otherwise it is wasting time and useless. Almost all the things taught after midterm is covered in the lecture notes except the solution for review questions.All about formulas of statistics and some examples related to them. You do not have to understand the reason but always know how to use the formulas.It is easy to learn how to apply those materials in class. Sometimes the teaching is interesting for comic pictures are quoted to help understand.Good. Easy when you prepare a nice cheat sheet.Only one midterm exam and one final exam. Light since this is "applied" statistics, you don't have to know what's going on behind the formulas. A well prepared cheat sheet (1 double sided A4 for midterm and 2 double sided A4 for final), technique to play with calculator and carefulness will lead you to A range.Probability and distributions (Binomial, Poission, Normal)
Confidence interval
Simple Linear Regression
Hypothesis Testing
ANOVA test
Statistical methods with two factors
Goodness of Fit Test

A general statistics course. Students mainly from MAEC. Studying as a COMP major requirement.Spoonfeeding type of teaching. In very detail did Dr. Yu try to teach his students how to tackle questions by doing exercises in class. The notes are printed by him but you have to bring it to class or else you can't fill the blanks in his notes.

Tutorials are terrible, with wrong answers and tutorials at 9am right before Friday's lecture. In total 4 hours of lecture time in a single day. Frustrating.The topics taught in MATH 2411 as follow:
1.    Descriptive Statistics
2.    Probability
3.    Random Variable and Probability Distribution
4.    Estimation
5.    Testing Hypothesis
6.    Simple Linear Regression
7.    Two-sample Problems
8.     ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
9.    Goodness-of-fit test

The most interesting part is probability and random variable part as it involves some basic integration technique learn form 1013 and set theory.

The remaining part (4-9) is quite boring as we just follows the rejection criteria and carry out lots of calculationHe taught style is interesting and explained the concept clearly in the lectureI will say that the content is so-so.  It didn't require too many logic thinking unless you want to know why the equation or theorem are grounded. All you need is a well-prepared cheat sheet, so you can just copy and paste on the exam paper. Strike a balance between eye-comfortableness and content abundance is very important, haha.The teaching is acceptable.   The lecture notes available online is not all completed.  Some spaces are left for you to jot down what the lecturer says in class. So,  totally relies on online lecture notes are not recommended. It is sometimes annoying that you may miss many things if you skip some lectures, results from late wake-up habits, time clash, etc.probability and stats
open book final( good luck with that)
literally printed everything still didnt helpprofessor is honestly cancer
he can't teach uh uh uh uh
his notes are garbage i'm not even kidding
do not expect to pass if you study using his notes
dont take this course if avery ching is teachingGarbage. Utter shit. The course content is pathetic. The instructor Literally gives zero fucks. And uhhhhhhh, he like to uhhhh a lot. The content is truly bullshit. DONT TAKE THE COURSE IF THIS NEANDERTHAL IS TEACHING!If only I had a dollar for every time He said Uhhh. Out of all the professors who ever taught me, Avery ranks pretty high in the top 10 hated professors on my list. He is absolutely horrible. You have better luck learning from a little baby who only says uhhh than learn a single thing from this idiot. Didn't go to a single lecture after the first week. The fact that Avery is a TEACHING FACULTY is beyond my understanding. Hate that guy.Content is limited but easy,maybe MATH2421 is more helpful and rigorous,however 2411 is the prequisite of 2421,so better take 2411 in advance.

If you know how to use the calculator efficiently and carefully,you can get a good grade.(Indeed I learnt how to use the calculator in this course!)I think the TA taught much better than the instructor.

The teaching was a little boring,but in general clear and helpful.

The TA explained problems clearly,carefully,and patiently,and he showed some proof of the theorem.Excellent TA!This course is applied math and the questions type are applied too. But the notes is theoretical. The contents of reference books is quite easy which help you to have a better understanding on the concept. But the level of exercises is too low compared with those question in the midterm and exam.The instructor explain the concepts clearly. But there are too less examples. Also, the examples are easy compared to midterm and exam.Before midterm:

- Fundamentals of set theory
- Basic combinatorics and probability, e.g., Counting, multiplication rule, independent events, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem
- Discrete and continuous random variables and probability distributions, e.g., binomial, Poisson, normal distributions

After midterm:
- Expectation
- Descriptive statistics, e.g., histogram, mean, mode, median, quartiles
- Estimation, hypothesis testing
- Linear regression (very briefly introduced)

This course is called APPLIED statistics.

Avery Ching somehow managed to make it like THEORETICAL statistics. The lecture notes are mostly proofs - which weren't tested at all!

He did give a few numerical examples, but all of them are elementary, way too easy compared to exam problems.Mediocre at best.

Don't expect to learn anything useful from his notes. I learned a lot more from WebWork.not allocated appropriate time to each topic
topics before midterm are really easyinteractive professor
spoon feeds you
if you attend lectures, you shall fair well
the book he recommends has good questions
but only do that when you finish tutorial questions
tutorial answers are uploaded by the ta which include solutions as wellTopics covered in midterm include probability, Venn diagram and some basic charts. Topics after midterm are more difficult. Review questions are important and you must understand. Overall the contents are not difficult.He is good in a way that he does not teach very fast like other lecturers and everytime when he finishes a topic he will finish review questions with students step by step. Sometimes I did not know what's going on until he demonstrated the review questions.

But tutorial is useless as the tutor kept teaching out syllabus materials.Before midterm: Probability and some basic statistical concepts like mean and sd. After midtem: distributions, hypothesis testing, estimation, linear regression.

Concepts are relatively easy to understand. To solve questions on the exam you just need to know how to use formulas most of the time. Cheatsheet is allowed on the final exam.

You also need to remember the R-codes, which is essentially a statistical programming language (just basic ones).

For a lot of problems you need to type a lot of data into the calculator, so a minor mistake can lead to a whole question wrong, which is stupid in my opinion. Using a more sophisticated calculator might be advantageousRarely attended class, because it is pretty boring. The teacher is okay, but the lecture is not efficient.

Review questions are very important to be understood, because the exams are based on them. Some exam questions are almost identical to the review ones. Review questions are covered only in class so make sure you get the solutions somehow.Only cover probability in midterm exam.
After midterm, it will cover normal distribution, hypothesis test, linear regression and other testing method. You just need to follow the equation to solve the problem.

In the final exam, no distribution was given, you have to understand how to read R code, all the probability was given in R code. You are allowed to bring one formula sheet to final but SO MANY regulation have to be followed.

Actually, the lecturer didn't regulate what calculator you can bring. If you have one graphic calculator, it would definitely helpful.I think his explanation is clear but the class was a little bot boring. Each chapter follow up with review questions and some with supplementary exercise, that provided us better understanding of course materials.Of all the maths course I have taken in HKUST, this gives the best and most relatable materials. Also, if you are into thinking deep of maths concept this course is quite good as many concepts are introduced in great length. Before midterms, the concepts are quite easy but questions are more difficult. After midterm, many equations with seemingly horrible symbols are introduced but really you just have to chill and relax and handle them. Once you get past the point of being scared of them, everything becomes easier.OK but I have never seen a professor wearing slippers to class. The attitude is quite casual but still, I could see he makes a lot of effort in teaching and to be fair, Steve Jobs wear the same set of clothes to work so he did that too! In lectures, we always discuss his fashion sense it's a great topic to discuss really highly recommend you guys take yu chi wai :) Just to feel comfier if you usually wear slippers to uni.the probability part before midterm is not difficult and similar to what is learned in high school math.

statistic after the midterm quite hard to understand (especially if you cant understand chapter 4, you will easily get lost afterward), but if you are not interested in the proof, its ok to know how to use the equation, and cheat sheet/formula sheet can be used in the exams. (may not be okay for those who want an A+ anyways :D)Actually, I just attend his first lesson LOL, so really can't tell how his teaching was.

Before midterm I did sit Yu Chi Wai lectures, well, it really bore and hard to follow his Hong Kong accent. But the demonstration shown in class is quite clear.

I nearly study all materials by myself, and it's not too hard to do so.It was about
1. Set Notation
2. Probabilities
3. Random Variables
4. Expectations
5. Descriptive Statistics
6. Statistics
7. Estimators
8. Hypothesis Testing
9. Linear RegressionAvery teaches very fast, his voice is a bit boring, so I wasn't very attentive. Don't ever expect you can study by yourself, as the notes he provides are too simple. Remember to study the examples he teaches in the lessons.For midterm
1)Introduction to the Information Infrastructure
2)Digital Convergence; Wireless Communications and Spectrum Regulation
3)The Next Generation Information Infrastructure
4)Business and Socioeconomic Implications of Information Infrastructure
5)Innovation 2.0

For final
6)Diffusion of Technology Innovation; Case Study: SMS Adoption in Hong Kong and China
7)Theoretical Framework of Information Infrastructure Deregulation
8)Organizational Restructuring of Information Infrastructure: From Monopoly to Competition, and to the Bubble and Its burst
9)Network Interconnection; Local Network Competition in Hong Kong
10)Key Issues of Global Information Infrastructure: International Settlement, IP Telephony, and the WTOProfessor always uses many examples to establish the idea which is easy to understand.

Professor XU comes from mainland China, however, his accent is quite clear to listen to.

He always tries to invite people to answer his questions and get involved in class. (but as always only a few people will answer him TT)The range of the covered content is quite broad, so it doesn't go in too deep.

Before the midterm, you learn basic set/logic theory, relations, counting.

Until final, you learn recurrence relations, graph theory, boolean algebra, number theory, discrete probability.

The lecture notes are well organized, but contains some mistakes, so be careful.

The general content/theory shouldn't be too hard compared to other math courses (very easy to be honest if you are decent at math).Teaching is not very good.
The professor doesn't speak very fluent English, so the delivery of the teaching is not very comprehensible. He tries quite hard to let the students grasp the concepts. But, because of the English and his delivery is not in a very organized manner, the efforts seem to be in vain.
But, the good thing is you don't need to go to the lectures every time even if you want to ace the course.Set theory
Logic
Counting
Binary Relation
Recurrence Relation
Graph Theory
Induction
Divisibility (Number Theory)

Actually all easy topics except recurrence relation (lazy to memorize), will be vary easy to handle for a yr2 student with enough math knowledge

Please refer to his website:Seldom attend lesson (morning lesson), but quite enjoy the lessons actually.The content is much similar to the one with the fall semester except that the professor included Gram Schmidt and symmetric matrices are not required.To me, Professor Huang Jingsong is a very good professor as he is knowledgeable, at least he can answer my questions very well. He welcomed questions from students, especially interesting ones and would prefer to discuss the questions in class. However, he does not provide any notes, for me, it is not an issue, but for those who prefer notes and direct teaching to the content, you might find him bad in teaching. I like his teaching style as he would introduce the proofs of the theorems (which is not required in the course). He usually teached contents that are not specified in the book and those content are not required.Week 1: Linear systems, row reduction to echelon form (reading: Sections 1.1-1.2)
Week 2: Vectors, matrix equations, linear independence (reading: Sections 1.3-1.5, 1.7)
Week 3: Matrices as linear transformations, applications (reading: Sections 1.8-1.10)
Week 4: Matrix multiplication, the inverse of a matrix (reading: Sections 2.1-2.3)
Week 5: Subspaces, null and column space, dimension (reading: Sections 2.4, 2.8-2.9)
Week 6: Determinants (reading: Sections 3.1-3.2)
Week 7: Vector spaces, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues (reading: Sections 4.1-4.6, 5.1)
Week 8: Similarity and diagonalisable matrices (reading: Sections 5.2-5.4)
Week 9: Complex eigenvalues, properties of eigenvalues (reading: Sections 5.5, 6.1)
Week 10: Inner products, orthogonality, and projections (reading: Sections 6.1-6.3)
Week 11: Gram-Schmidt process, least-squares problems (reading: Sections 6.4-6.6)
Week 12: Symmetric matrices, singular value decompositions (reading: Sections 7.1, 7.4)

You will find the difficulty of the course in the last few weeks escalated quickly. But the content before mid-term are just things in M2 in high school.The professor teaches with heart and willing to spend time in the study break to organize a review lecture. He also likes answering student's question. The reason I give B is that he really just read out the things on the notes in the lectures.A typical introductory course on linear algebra, and I guess this one is more focused on the theoretical aspect of the subject. However, it didn't cover too many topic; even professor said that he didn't got everything covered on time. So I guess from the academic aspect, this single course will not really provide you enough background in linear algebra for whatever field you are in.We all be in UST long enough to know UST has no real good professor.

Prof. Chang is an average one. His words are fairly understandable, and as a person he is quite funny. I like his sense of humor; he sometime tells some funny math jokes.

He tended to write a lot on the broad and use some unnecessarily large examples. The lecture are mostly focused on proofs, especially the second part of the course (i.e. after midterm), so the lectures can get fairly dense. Once you get lost, it is unlikely that you will be back on track again on that day's lecture. Though, for people who are interested in pure math, I guess the rigorous maths  might be able to provide some insights.

For Prof. Chang alone, I will give a B~B- for teaching. But what's really the problem is the TA.

I only went to the tutorial twice, and I never understood a single words from the TA.The material in this course is quite good.
Just read lecture notes is enough.
However, this course is more difficult than previous as more proof and theorem need to study than before. Some of them need to spend time to understand.
There would be some questions that about explaining terms. Need to memorize terms.
Practice mid-term and final is provided. Follow the content of it to study as the content of MT and final is similar to them.A little bit boring as he just read the lecture notes.

However, there is no lecture video and the lecture notes posted on the website is too brief. You have to attend all the lessons.Nothing specific at all. But for professor marberg, u should understand the concepts fully. In exam and test, some concept-based Q will appear. So, understanding all the properties and concept can help you achieve a better grade.His teaching is OK, reading from his prepared notes. In fact, if u are lazy, u can skip all the classes, and just read the notes yourselves. The only advantage of attending class is to have an opportunity to ask questions.1.

some typing mistake in notes and he copy the wrong one
no need to attend lessonBasic concepts and applications of matrices and linear system. It's not very difficult even if you study by yourself. The main point is understand the concepts.His notes is comprehensive but his teaching is a little bit boring, which is just repeating every word on his notes. His whiteboard writing is just like the copy of his notes. Because even you take his class, you may not understand the contents, so it's totally feasible to study by yourself.There are many abstract concepts and proofs in class which made me very confused. But few proofs is required in exams.

For the TA, I strongly recommend CHEUNG Ho Man (I cannot remember if this is his name. He wears a pair of black glasses and beard.)
He supplemented the best questions that need lots of proof to train our thinking and abilities. I learned a lot from his tutorials.- Linear Equations in Linear Algebra
- Matrix Algebra
- Determinants
- Vector Spaces
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Orthogonality and Least-Squares
- Symmetric Matrices and Quadratic Forms

The first 3 chapters are pretty easy, but you need to spend some time understanding the rest chapters perfectly.Good professor. His teaching is clear and easy to follow. Plus, he is humorous. The tutorial class taught by TA is meaningless though...The content was very straightforward, and it will be extremely useful for the physics courses that follow (if you are a Physics major/minor student).

7.2 Quadratic FormsI didn't like Prof. Huang's teaching at all. He kept jumping from topic to topic, and he would jump back to a topic if he realized he forgot to mention something. He also occasionally covers some advanced topics that are irrelevant to the course, and it just confuses me more. If you find it hard to follow his teaching, I would recommend using the textbook to learn by yourself, or asking the TA, since the TA explains the content very well.The lecture covers linear equations in linear algebra, matrix algebra, determinants, vector spaces, eigenvalues and eigenvectors and orthogonality. The topics are not difficult to learn even for people with little or no knowledge of linear algebra, but understanding how each of the theorems work could be quite tricky. For eigenvectors and orthogonality, the lecture only covers the first one third of the whole chapter.The professor was very enthusiastic about the lecture, and I enjoyed the lecture. However, sometimes his lecture was quite difficult to understand especially when he tried to explain how to prove theorems that are complicated. There is 5 minute break at the middle of the lecture for allowing students to take a short break or go to the bathroom.The content is not much and also very easy to understand. The most difficult part is the concept of vector space as well as proof of a vector space. However, those part is not included in the midterm and final examinations.Dont know coz i didnt attend any lessonBasic linear algebra concepts from matrix equation to orthogonality. Heavily concentrated on the mathematical parts and not many applications are studied/explored.English is very good for a math professor. Explanations are clear. The only point of improvement is that he writes his notes so small on the board that students usually just take pictures and study them later. His fashion could be better too. :PVery easy,
Just the advanced version of M2.The lecturer has ok English level but not so easy to understand. The tutorial session is so useful, although the exercise gave is not( Since they will not require you to prove some thm during midterm and final exam.)- Systems of linear equations, echelon form
- Vectors in R^n, linear dependence, span
- Linear transformations and matrices
- Determinants
- Vector spaces and subspaces
- Col A, Nul A, Row A etc.
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Inner product and orthogonality

Quite interesting.
The level is however too elementary for math majors.Never went to class.

His notes are concise.The course is  about some simple linear algebra including  simple calculation of matrix,inverse matrix, sub-spaces and linear combination.The professor is really funny and his explanation is quite clear .He gives notes in lesson and canvas. If he can write the words in bigger size on the whiteboard ,it would be better for the students.They content is quite easy,
The most difficult part is diagonalisation
The exam is very similar to the exam in last year,  As you do the pastpaper, you should be all right.The notes are already enough for you to learn
Prof will provide proves in class which are absent in notes,
proves will not appear in examOverall contents are all related to matrix. all concepts are definitely easy to understand, questions are all very straight forwards. literally there is NO questions with tricks (well of course,T/F questions are not in the dealing table.)I definitely see that he has his passion in teaching, but his delivering ability is not clear. Moreover, his unordinary weird style of accents and pronunciation doubles the confusion. I consistently attended his lecture at first, but decided to self-study.The major topics includes: systems of linear equations in algebra, matrix operations, determinants, vector spaces, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, orthogonality.

The knowledge studying in HKDSE M2 will be adequate for first a few chapters. The concept is important, especially the relations between each chapters.

Although this course content studies deeper than MATH2111(similar topics for engineering students), this course does not teach: least square(for linear regression in stat), inner product space, Gram-Schmidt process (maybe in this term only =.= as the syllabus requires him to do so), while the easier course MATH2111 teaches.The professor speaks so softly and it always makes the atmosphere of the classes becoming boring. Sometimes, his writes the words on the white broad a bit in a mess. The lecture always contains a numerous of proof about the theorem and the lecture notes are too simple.

The professor may also not be free or vigorous to answer your questions after the lecture, so you can ask the TA.

The tutorial session usually provide enough exercises for practice (depending on different sessions).Systems of Linear Equations
Matrix Operations
Determinants
Vector Spaces and Subspaces
Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
Orthogonality

Most of them only need the method of basic calculation is enough for the course.Professor speak quite softly and has a small handwriting on the board. If you cannot sit on the first 3 row of the classroom, you may found difficult in following the lecture.

If you want to learn the concept clearly and know the prove, you can go to the lecture as the lecture note is quite brief. If you have time, I will encourage you to sit 2131, there is much more concept of linear algebra you can learn and the explanation is much clear.Content seems similar to the DSE M2 but actually it will use many new terms that explain the theorem or the ways of doing it.
Dont rely on your DSE and please listen to the tutor even you think you know what he is talking about.I will say Meng GuoWu is a moderate teacher only.
He will answer students' questions in details but he will use the terms that you need to have revision to know what he is saying.
He wrote so many things on the blackboard and not using the notes he put in the website that makes people hard to follow.Quite easy before midterm about approximation and something like taylor series. But it will become bit difficult after midterm so more time is needed torevise.No lecture notes provided as Dr.Leung writes all materials on the whiteboard. So though attendance will not be taken, regular taking of lectures is important.The content is standard for an elementary number course. If you are a pure math student, then it is advised you should take this course regardless of your specialty.

p-adic numbers, quadratic field are not mentioned this year. Prof. Xiong presented the content in a way such that a minimal algebraic background would suffice.Prof. Xiong is very detailed and meticulous in teaching. He is explained every details very clearly with moderate pace, this could potential benefit novice. However, occasionally he just focus on trivial details, making the true meaning of theorem/formula obscure.

The tutorial TA given is also very informative, he focus largely on numerical and concrete examples, which is nice if you're new to number theory.Basic number theory. Main concepts: Fermat Little Theorem , Euclidean algorithm , modular arithmetic , Will's theorem , convolution , Gaussian integers are primes. It maybe a bit abstract if you are not mature in Math enough and you will easily get lost in the lectures, but the problems are quite computational(in the exams). The pre-requisite is not needed essentially.His teaching is abstract in lecture, esp. this is a new area for most of the students. However, you can visit his office when you are confused where he will make things clear and you will get it after consulting him.I. Pre-requisite:
1. Maturity in linear algebra, with a good understanding of the elementary contents as well as the dual spaces, multi-linear transformations etc. (he will cover these topics with one lecture so don't worry if you have never encountered such things);
2. Mastering the basic calculus contents, with the multi-variable version included;
3. Familiarity of the commutative diagrams will save your tears much, though it is not required at all.

He is quite patient and willing to answer students'  questions. Any difficulties in understanding the course materials will be figured out
and explained later. Try to follow his thinking patterns.

Sit in the front of the classroom HELPS.

No worry for his English, which is among the best of Math Dept.You should learn Fina3000s courses first before you take this course.
All maths-sf students are struggling to catch up the materials that fina or quantitative finance students already have known. Maths doesnt matter in this course. you just need to have a bit of understanding on stats.Very bad.
I dont know why he kept explaining on unimportant materials on final or midterm. There are too many mistakes on his lecture notes.
you should be careful when you revise them.The content is useful but is not really well organized. The notes and the homework have a lot of typo. And when he changes the contents, he won't email you. You need to find out yourself.The professor doesn't seem to prepare for classes. It is really confusing for everyone and sometimes confusing for himself as well.Mid term: currency forward, call/put options and strategies, arbitrage pricing, spot & swap & forward rate, forward rate agreement and DV01.

Final: DV01, Duration, Convexity, key rate shift, Binomial model for interest rate, Eurodollar Future, Black–Scholes model.

Though it is not cumulative, there are a lot to cover in each exam.Prof and teaching material are very poor. Prof seems not certain about the concept he teaches as he sometimes correct himself immediately after explaining something.

Teaching material can mess you up. The organization of the chapters are poor that you may find similar slides many times in different chapters. It makes the course hard to follow and I spend so much time to organize those concepts.

While the TA is helpful and patient, the tutorial notes are far easier to follow and I mostly use the notes to study. It is encouraged to attend tutorials. Whenever we have questions, he is so keen to answer.The course covers forwards, futures, options, bonds, bond options, swaps, swaptions etc. Focus is put on calculations of different rates and prices of the above derivatives. Initially the content may look familiar if you have studied financial derivatives before, but the concepts are put into mathematical context (e.g. formulas). It grows a lot more difficult when it goes into topics of rates and bond options. Thorough understanding of the concepts is needed to perform well in the exams, since it involves many proofs rather than plain calculations.Both the powerpoint slides and professor's teaching in class are poorly organized. Most of the time people don't pay attention since the professor speaks at monotone and people find it difficult to understand what he tried to say. No attendance counted so many people did not go to class when the semester reaches its end.- counting and probability
- discrete random variables
- continuous random variables
- joint pdf and marginal pdf
- independence and sum of iid variables
- expectation, correlation, covariance, mgf

First chapters are very similar to the one discussed in MATH 2411, but please train yourself to do exercise and proof.Dr. Yu is a great teacher. His proof are clear, examples help you to understand the subject.

But please, attend his lectures. Slides are not completed, so you have to go to take notes.Probability theory, random variables, probability distributions, expectation, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression models.

Just refer to YU CHI WAI's webpage, as he will change the content occasionally .

The content will be a little bit of mixing  the content of linear algebra and Multivariable Calculus. So be prepared before taking this course.YU CHI WAI's teaching style is that you need(have) to attend his lecture to jot down many complemental notes. Otherwise, you may lose many important key.

He is also a nice, easy-going professor. English is also quite good and clear.The teaching material for this course is mainly about characteristics of different continuous or discrete distribution. Personally, I think it is relatively easy comparing to Multivariable Calculus. All you need to do is just understanding the proof shown in the lectures. And If you like statistic, this course will definitely make you very excited. But if you dislike statistic, then I recommend you not to take this course.His teaching approach is just reading out the lecture notes and writing some important equations for at least 1/3 of the lesson. However, those notes you have written down help you to remember the proof and logic, which are beneficial to your exam. As the other commentary said, checking paper is a good way for you to have a higher mark. Try to write steps for every questions since those steps are the key for a sub-grade.Chap 1:  Combinatorial analysis
Chaps 2 and 3 :Axioms, Independence and Conditional probability
Chaps 4 and 5: Random variables and Probability distributions
Chap 6: Joint distributions of random variables
Chap 7: Expectation and Moment generating functions
Chap 8: Law of large numbers

the content before midterm is easy and similar to the content of MATH 2411.
After midterm, the content is more difficultprofessor is quite good. Very patient to teach us and answer our questions.The contents are as following:
1. Combinatorial analysis
2, 3. Axioms, Independence and Conditional Probability
4, 5. Random variables and probability distributions
6. Joint distributions of random variables
7. Expectation and Moment generating functionsI was a bit disappointed about the lecturer, because the lecture was not much different from the lecture notes. Therefore, this means that I could self study in this course, and catch up all the content materials. However, the lecturer's pronunciation is quite good, and the lecture note is very clear.first 1/3 similar to 2411, but the focus is on concept and proof, not examples or calculation.
later talk about joint/marginal/conditional distribution, need 2023 knowledge. comb through the logic and it should not be hard. then moment generaint function, this part quite useful.
this semester the professor taught a bit faster than before so as to add the WLLN/SLLN/CLT in the last chapter.  A bit harder to understand, but this is the essence of probability theory right? Try to think about it more. Will be helpful in PG courses.Errrr```This professor has terrible accent...I cannot hear him clearly, nor can I focus at all. He did not explain the examples enough, just read it, not leading us through the thinking process. So mostly it is just a self-taught course then.Rich (in proofs). Easy in the beginning. Notes are sufficient but have too many fill in the blanks. So while you're blindly copying from the board, you're wasting precious hours. If you miss the lectures you may not only have to google the difficult-to-find answers, but may also miss the in-class assignments (2% each) which should be outlawed from grading since the answer is given in the classroom (basically surprise attendance).The prof is a good person, for he easily increases your score during paper checking and sympathizes with your unfortunately humongous schedule. However, his teaching is lackluster, dispirited (since he is prone to mumbling to an audience) and limited to writing on the whiteboard that which could have simply been filled into the notes. But you don't have an option to take another prof as long as you take this course in spring.The course is a much more in-depth version of MATH1014, with emphasis on proof.
At first the definition and test of existence of definite integral will be taught, which is quite hard a part in this course. Fundamental theorem of calculus will be proved.
Then comes the techniques of integration (integration of rational functions and change of variables are subtle), improper integrals and application of integrals (arc length, surface area, volumes, ...).
Infinite series and their convergence (absolute and conditional) will be discussed. Another interesting but hard part of this course.
Fourier series is amazing with many incredible results but relatively easy, but more emphasis will be put on Fourier analysis and uniform convergence, which will not be tested.
Caution: Be punctual for class or just skip it. Don't be late.The accent of Prof HU is a little mellow and it may be hard to catch up with his speech at first.
However, Prof HU is serious with conducting the proof and explaining the reasoning. Very often he will talk about something else and deviate from the real content for a while, but he will come back and explain it clearly.This course is very difficult.
Although the topics are pretty much the same as 1014, the examples and questions include more complex cases, therefore require much better understanding.
The professor even had to give guidelines on how to answer one of question in the final exam.Professor Yan is very good at explaining the mathematical concepts in simple words. There is always clear logic behind his speech. I dare to say that he does a better job at explanation than Ho Hong Ming (but not as prepared and practiced).This course didn't have much content - unlike 1023 - and I thought 1014 covered even more topics. Perhaps the only differences are the level of difficulty in exams and the written homework.

Topics include: improper integrals, arc length, area of revolution, parametric equations, polar coordinates, convergence tests for series, power series, Taylor series

Fourier series, which were included in the past few years, were left out this time. I guess because there wasn't enough time.I only went to class a few times. The lectures weren't very helpful but the tutorials were okay.

One thing I found annoying is that he *always* assigned some problems on a Monday and the rest on Wednesday (sometimes Thursday) when it was due on Friday.High Order Approx.(revision of the maths1023)
Concave/ Convex Function
Newton Method
The rigorous definition of Integration( Jordan measure, limit of sequence)
Application of Integration( surface of revolution....., polar)
convergence of series( Abel test, Derichlet test ,radius of convergence....)
Fourier Series

I don't recommend 1013 students to take 1024 in spring semester because it is very hard to catch up.Although Prof. Min Yan always calculate wrong, he good at deliver the main idea in mathematical  analysis.@@ No Fourier Series covered this semester. I guess because there wasn't enough time. But unlike previous years, we had a detailed coverage on the practical side of calculus, that Prof. Hu talked a lot on parametric curves and polar coordinates. Though sketching polar curves wasn't tested, I've become very proficient at drawing basic polar curves now. Polar curves are pretty~

I think overall we have a more in-depth discussion on every topic. If not, at least your fear for failing the exam would propel you to study hard, and thus gain better insights on the covered topics than normal 1013 people. It's overall a rewarding experience, you gain more as you study more.

If you come from 1013, you might have a bit of problem with Series.Prof. Hu can hook you especially when he teaches theoretical stuff. But when he teaches the applications of calculus, you might find his lectures a bit boring.

The TA is awesome (y).We mainly focused on studying properties and proofs. There was little focus on actual calculations. Overall I found the content very interesting and rewarding because we were able to rigorously define everything.

I found the lectures before midterm very challenging, partly due to me having studied very little linear algebra before and partly due to Prof. Moy's teaching style (more on that in the teaching session). However, the lectures after the midterm, although still difficult, were a bit more manageable as i got used to the mathematical terms.

Week 12. Spectral Theory
Week 13. Cayley-HamiltonProf. Moy talks fast. He doesn't explain the concepts too well. And he kind of laughs awkwardly whenever someone asks a question as if the question is stupid. Having said that, I still think he's a nice and friendly person and I respect him as a mathematician, but maybe not so much as a teacher.

The TA is pretty bad. He speaks softly and unclearly. His handwriting on the whiteboard is very difficult to see. He doesn't correct the handwritten HW and simply gives everyone full marks. This is because the TA gives the solutions to the HW before the duedate everytime.Overall: Well-organized, concise, with examples explaining the main points. The notes are written and used by Prof. MOY. Maybe subjected to copyright.

Usually takes 13 weeks (or more) to accomplish the lectures on all the topics. It is possible that the Prof will omit certain parts for due courses.Clear and step-by-step.

It might not be that comfortable to accept so much brand new concepts at the very beginning. But Allen Moy always tries his best to make everything clear and rigorous if students have any question. Should you have any confusion, please just raise your hands during the lectures, and he is quite nice and always be ready to help students.

He laughs a lot (where you wouldn't get the points XD). One of the top instructors in Dept. of MATH.You can learn more deeper in the topic of Matrices, Vectors and Linear Transformation which are very new to candidates who did not have self-learning. If you are an M2 student, please don’t think that those things are not important, since it is an Honor course which asks for definition very rigorously.

Yan Min’s notes are not well-written. A lot of mistakes and unclear concepts in his notes.Yan Min’s teaching method is well-known. No need to talk much. Only focus on simple questions and copy and paste things from his notes, no logic teaching.Vector Space:

And the TA is also good and most likely teaches us how to finish some of the most difficult questions of the assignments in tutorial. He also tries his best to mark the assignments higher so you need not worry about the grading of the assignments.Linear algebra is absolutely useful for most student and Prof. Yan's lecture note is clear though there may be some mistakes.However it's hard to follow Prof.Yan 's leaping thinking sometimes. So it may take you some time to understand his lecture notes and it's necessary to digest his course after each class.Prof.Yan always suggest us use geometrical view to solve questions and he did explain some concepts geometrically. Prof.Yan speaks fast but there are many five-minute breaks in one course to digest what he said. However ,his course is still abstract so that you should pay much attention on what he said.
To sum, his teaching is not perfect but not bad.
TA will explain last week's lecture more precisely in tutorial so you should not miss any tutorial if you have difficulty in learning.The only fly in the ointment is that tutorial will no more keep up with the schedule after midterm when Prof. Yan begin to speed up the course.Teaching topics:
1. Vector space
2. Linear Transformation
3. Subspace
4. Inner product space
5. Determinant
6. General Linear Algebra [complex vector space and complex inner product]
7. Spectral TheoryHe teaching is ok and encourages student to think deeply in linear algebra as it is fundamental subject in maths which is useful for understanding abstract algebra or other advanced maths topics.i am year 1 IB graduate with only a sorry 6 in HL math, i am not doing too bad right now, so i mean its not that tough. and after take this course u feel like u have actually learned shit, so its very satisfying. i recommend.in the first lesson he said "you should approach mathematics rigorously, but learning mathematics should be casual" tbh i think he meant "teaching mathematics should be casual" cuz his teaching is kinda random. i mean he understands it but like, I DON'T!

teaching: not ok lor!!!
at first i thought i was stupid thats y i didn't understand, but even the mainlanders complain!!!! though i mean teaching is not cancer level. but i heard yan min teaches 2043, 3043 and topolgy very well.
Let me give you an example. At the start for a new a section of a chapter (6.1.4), he proved something about a special case that only applies when the Dim(Re(V))  is even - V is complex vector space. BUT HE DIDN'T SAY ITS A SPECIAL CASE. AND KEEP IN MIND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A SECTION SO U WOULD EXPECT HIM TO DO THE GENERAL CASE! So i though i didn't understand complex vector space, but really it was just that I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS MAGICAL BEAST CALLED YAN MIN!!!!! I asked the math support center, they didn't know, i asked the TA, TA didn't know. finally i went can go to his office and ask him, and he gave a pretty nice explanation about the special case and what it is used for BUT WHY U NO WRITE THIS IN THE NOTE!!!?!!

u should watch 3Blue1Brown youtuber's videos: Essence of Linear Algebra it will help u learn shit faster. its like visual and introductory so very friendly to n00bs like meThe course content is quite good and covers most important topics of linear algebra. The topics covered are:
a)Functions
b)Groups and Rings
c)Dimension
d)Matrices
e)Change of coordinates
f)Linear Systems
g)Dot Products
h)Inner Products
i)Multi-linear Functions and Determinants
j)Eigenvectors and eigenvalues
k)Self Adjoint transformations
l)Cayley Hamilton Theorem

The only negative thing being the notes contain a lot of notations that make very simple things look complicated.  Also it defines a lot of objects at the start many of which are not studied in the course which is bit weird.He does not give much intuition behind the definitions or the results. He just gives a definition followed by a couple of examples and then a result and its proof without emphasizing on where it came from or on its importance. While giving the proofs he just mechanically goes through it without explaining the main idea too well.the course content is easy to understand if you are hardworking and do regular exercise. However this professor are focus too much in the concept part, all the exam questions are asking your concept with the course content...(The exam question unlike the homework and the material on the tutorial)The lesson is so boring and the professor's sound will make you fall in sleep-First order and second order linear ODE with constant coefficient
-High order linear ODE with constant coefficient
-Series solution
-Laplace Transform
-System of linear ODE (real, complex, repeated eigenvalues)
-Fourier Series
-Partial differential equation(heat conduction)

Knowledge in Math 2121 and a bit knowledge in Jordan form of matrix are needed when solving system of linear ODE. The contents are not difficult at all and they are understandable provided that effort is paid.Do not teach well in the lectures but he is willing to answer your questions after class and you will find that he is knowledgeable to the subject. The best way to learn is to read the material by yourself (can find the textbook and the answer online easily) and ask him for help if there is any question. I attend lecture to know which topics he has completed.Before midterm:
- first order equations (separation of variables, integrating factors, existence and uniqueness theorem etc.)
- second and higher order linear equations (characteristic equation, method of undetermined coefficients, variation of parameters etc.)
- series solutions

After midterm:
- Laplace transform
- systems of linear differential equations
- Fourier transforms and the heat equation

Looks quite a lot of content, but not really, for example, one can find many parallels between linear algebra (MATH 2121) and systems of linear differential equations. Also, many of the methods in solving a single equation (e.g. undetermined coefficients; variation of parameters) can be generalised to a system of equations.

Series solutions are the hardest part of the course, however they were never tested in exams. Fourier series do look daunting but only the basics are required (e.g. how to derive the coefficients).

Mainly about straightforward calculations and basic derivations from the textbook.His notes are pretty much useless since they are copied directly from the textbook. The organisation is poor as well.The course covers basic techniques to solve differential equations and is ideal for students intending to apply mathematics to their disciplines. Certain topics were excluded such as fourier transforms and bifurcation theory.Dr. Ching is a very organized lecturer with a clear flow of thought. He works out every example in detail and offers plenty of instances where a concept may be applied. He gives breaks at appropriate moments and can communicate ideas well.For this year's summer term, Dr. Ching did not include series solution and the Sturm-Liouville theory. The basic concepts for eigenvalues and eigenvectors are essential for this course, so, I do not reccomend you to take without the prerequisite unless you self study eigenvalues and eigenvectors yourself.I think Dr. Ching teaches very well. He can deliver a lecture of 3 hours without looking at any notes. He can memorize all the steps and answers for his examples. However, he would not tell you how to get the answers (eigenvalues and eigenvectors), so, make sure you know how to do all his examples by yourselfFirst thing first, I actually took this course in 2011-2012 Spring. But I don't have the choice for that when writing this review.

Lectures slides very useless. Reference book poorly written. If you have an option not to take this course, just don't.His voice is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard. And he takes 50% of the lecture time bull-shiting, and the rest just skipping slides. He did not go to the lecture on time as well.

Tho he just read through the powerpoint throughout the lesson, when you have something do not understand, you can just directly ask him and Tony Shing (TA) after the lecture and he was really willing to clarify all the things.How can we model a star qualitatively
(or be more precise, main sequence stars)
How star forms, how star evolutes, and how star dies.
(basically you can fully understand those documentaries about stars after this course)

If you have interest in astronomy and generally don't aim very high grade, this course is good for you.Good teaching due to small class
(this year only 16 students took this course)
Prof. can explain complicated ideas in a relatively easier way for us to understand. He can respond to our question effectively, (and he sometimes make jokes)
Mark release of courseworks on canvas are quite efficient.
(in a very short period after completion of the respective coursework)

(much better than my major's prof. in general, which is mech)The course cover structures and physics of various types of stars and related objects, from how a main-sequence stars forms, stellar infrastructure to how different stars die and the physics of white dwarfs and neutron stars.Teaching is quite good and most students focus on the lesson. the class work is sometime too long so we need to do them after class and hand in at that day.Topics: (1) Basic thermodynamics; the first law, ideal gas, etc. (2) The second law & entropy (3) Thermodynamic identity (4) Heat engine, Carnot cycle (5) Thermodynamic potentials  (6) Boltzmann Statistics (7) Quantum Statistics

It is basically just Ch.1 - 7 of the textbook, with Ch.4 more or less skipped. It is very standard for an introductory course on thermal physics, and I especially like this balanced treatment between classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

The textbook (Schroeder) is a good one. It is in general very understandable and "reader-friendly". The author's writing style make the book kind of like a "Griffiths" in thermodynamics. If you have the time, I highly suggest you to read through the textbook.

Unfortunately though, Schroeder did not do a very good job on quantum statistics (ch.7) like the rest of the book and make the subject mysteriously difficult to understand from his explanation. Therefore, I would suggest you to obtain a secondary text for the quantum statistics part. I personally uses Stowe's "Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics", which is readily available from the library and is on about the same level & scope as Schroeder (so it can also be used as a supplement to other topics).Dr. Cheung is a standard one. He mostly just read aloud the PowerPoint in class, and sometime do some explanation on the whiteboard (especially for the stat mech part).

I can tell he has a good altitude toward teaching. But unfortunately, due to his limited English proficiency and teaching skills, I really can't say his teaching is good at all. But at least he did try his best to be helpful, for example, he often upload a lot of supplementary material on Canvas and give hints to the homework problems, and he replies email inquiry at an extremely fast rate.

For the course material, although I always think teaching physics with PowerPoint is simply ridiculous, the PowerPoint slides used by this course are so far the only one I found to be acceptable for a physics course. They explain things quite clearly and often offer alternative derivation to some of the major result in the textbook. The exams are based more on the content of the PowerPoint, so I suggest you to read through them to get used to  the alternative methods and notations, when studying for the exam.

The TA will work through several problems (and go through the homework) during the tutorial session.From the basics to quantum statistics: Laws of thermodynamics, entropy, thermodynamic relations, Carnot cycle, free energy to Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics.Dr. Cheung tries his best to explain the materials in the lectures but his spoken English is not very good so sometimes I get confused before I truly understand his words. But revisions before and after a lecture helps quite a lot to comprehend and catch up with the class. As a natively-Cantonese-speaking Hongkonger, Dr Cheung is passionate to answer students question in Cantonese/Mandarin during the break or after the lecture. He also tries to interact with us by asking us simple questions and giving classwork with discussions with each other. His notes are easy to understand: like main points are highlighted and details with examples are given for some key concept. Overall his teaching is quite good. The tutorial session is to explain the homework given with full solutions given. It makes us easier to understand the materials and prepare well before the exams.The content before mid-term is quite easy : ideal gas law, multiplicity, entropy, first law, second law, and engine.

The content after mid-term is more challenging, but it is manageable
: Thermal Identities, Free Energy, Boltzmann statistic and Quantum statistic.

Overall the course content would not be too much or too difficult to master in the short summer semester.The lecturer has prepared great powerpoint, the powerpoint may use different, but easier approach or method to solve a problem compare to the recommended textbook.
The lecturer's presentation is clear but quite boring, the pace of teaching is fair.

The tutorial section is useful, as the tutor would explain the solution of classwork and homework, and you are available to change your homework answer after knowing the correct answer after the tutorial section.The teaching content is following the book - An introduction to thermal physics (Daniel V. Schroeder)
Midterm: Chapter 1 to 4.
Final: Chapter 1 to 7 (meanly focused on 5 to 7).
first part is just the thermodynamics and multiplicity.
second part is Boltzmann and quantum statistics.
Some derivation may be differ from the book's.
And not every part of the book has been taught due to the time limitation. (e.g real engine, maxwell relation, Ising model)Teaching is bad, most of the time Dr. CHEUNG just read the ppt.I think the content designed for this course is quite good as most of us that took this course are new to statistical mechanics. It provides us a new approach towards physical systems. However, towards the end of the course, the part on quantum statistics can be very hard. I found some difficulty in mastering it as the integration and the application of concepts on the physical systems can be hard. Also, there is limited time in mastering it.Professor Cheung is a responsible guy. He tries his best to teach this course even though he has some difficulties in explaining using English. However, I can see that he puts a lot of effort. So, don't just judge him by his English.Basically a differential equation course aimed specifically to physics students. The material covered are more or less the same as that of MATH2352, but less focused on the theoretical aspect of the subject and is taught more in the context of physics.

Topics: (1) Complex numbers (2) First order differential equations (linear and some others) (3) Second order differential equations, mostly constant coefficient (4) Laplace Transform (5) Dirac-delta function, Green function, convolution (6) System of differential equation, bifurcation (7) Fourier series and Fourier Transform

Notice that complex number only appear in the quiz, and for some unknown reasons, almost the whole final is filled with Fourier.

The content is solid for a first course in differential equations and is well chosen for a course aimed at physics students, but some of the topics are not covered in much depth much more than the computation method, which leave me quite puzzled by their physical meanings or theoretical details sometime.I am surprised that only that few reviews are written for this course. Prof. Jo is one of the best professor I encountered so far in UST and is far better than many of the professors in the physics department. He is very enthusiastic in teaching, and he is always trying his best to help the students, as he said in the first lecture, "your enemy is not me but the university's regulation. I want to give a good grade to everyone, but I need you to help me".

I really enjoyed Prof. Jo's teaching style. His spoken English is very good and clear (one of the best in the Physics department) and he doesn't speak with a monotonic voice. He write on the whiteboard during lectures, which is by far better than all the hideous PPT that many physics professors love to use. More importantly, he created a somewhat relaxed and encouraging learning environment that help making the whole learning progress positive.

Prof. Jo writes his own lecture notes (either hand-written or typed), on which his lecture are based on. The hand-written notes are quite pleasant to read, but the typed notes are sometime a little bit loosely organized (especially the Fourier part), so I would recommend you to also have a look in the textbook (which is also very good). Also, the pace of Prof. Jo's lecture can be quite fast and even hard to follow sometime (especially those after the midterm) , so it is a good practice to preview a little bit before the lecture.This course mainly focuses on the techniques in solving ODEs, and some basic introduction to complex numbers.
The materials taught in this course is actually quite practical. Compared with MATH2352, some relatively complex technique such as variation of parameter and reduction of order are excluded, but instead gives an introduction to some special function such as Green's function.Prof. Jo is enthusiastic in teaching. He always asks for feedbacks from students before lectures start. The pace of his teaching is relativley slow as he will show the steps one-by-one in detail(may be too slow for some sthdents). Also, the lecture notes are well-prepared in terms of content for revision.I think the content is quite manageable and fun compare to other maths course I learnt so far.
Compare to its couterparts Math2352 (which is requirement for Maths and Phys track, I think), the content is broader but shallower. There are not so much proof work to do and all you need to do is using right way to do it (Because there are many ways to solve ODE and Green's theroem is quite difficult)Professor Jo is amazing. He is the best lecturer I seen in this campus so far.
He explains things nicely and talks with smile and non-monotonic voice.
He will write all the notes on the blackboard so please be punctual. And the notes he put in the LMES (maybe Canvas also in future) is just equal to he wrote but without steps and pictures.Textbook: Analytical Mechanics by Grant R.Fowles
The textbook is not really good... Some section in each chapter is devoted to Matlab simulation, so it is apparently more engineering-oriented. Ironically all the Matlab part is just omitted in the course o_o

For content, just look at description:
Newtonian mechanics, including rigid bodies (reading lots of formulas for 3D rotations)
Oscillating systems (memorizing and reading formulas)
Gravitation (reading formulas) and planetary motion
Lagrange equations, Hamilton's equations (these two should be focuses, but actually only a tiny bit is covered)
Normal modes and small oscillations (scattered throughout the course)
and an unmentioned but important part:
Change of reference frame (scattered throughout the course)

I call it "reading formulas", because it literally is. Those interesting results are just guided through and forgotten. Classical mechanics should be something beautiful and elegant, but it is made so boring and insipid.The PPTs cover a proper subset of the textbook contents, and the professor covers a proper subset of PPT contents in class at a slow and boring pace.The content mainly the advanced version of Phys1112, with more equations and even with difficult Maths methods.
It is a parallel course with Phys2124 (means they are co-requisite), but the Maths used in this course is a bit faster than that taught in 2124. (For example, we need to solve ODE in 3032 before it is being taught in 2124).
And you need to really pay attention in class or else you will lose track of the course.You really need to focus in the class because there are something wrong in the powerpoint but he never correct that after lessons. And he will just proof the equations by writing in the ppt but during class, he will just point at the steps and sometimes he don't even know what he is talking about.midterm above mean one SD, final  above mean one SD, A range.Originally, the course content is interesting. It pretty much has everything a physics undergraduate would expect, but the way in which the course was taught was an absolute joke.

Pure trash textbook by the way.Powerpoint reading, standard stuff. Problem is that the powerpoints are pretty much packed with so much detail you can't really keep up with it.

You go to lectures just so you know where the class is up to.The textbook used in this course is Fowles' "Analytical Mechanics" 7th edition. Lecture slides are divided by the chapters of the textbook:
CHAPTER 1. FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS: VECTORS
CHAPTER 2. NEWTONIAN MECHANICS: RECTILINEAR MOTION OF A PARTICLE
CHAPTER 3. OSCILLATIONS
CHAPTER 4. GENERAL MOTION OF A PARTICLE IN THREE DIMENSIONS
CHAPTER 5. NONINERTIAL REFERENCE SYSTEMS
CHAPTER 6. GRAVITATIONAL AND CENTRAL FORCES
CHAPTER 7. DYNAMICS OF SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES
CHAPTER 8. MOTION OF RIGID BODIES
CHAPTER 9. MOTION OF RIGID BODIES IN THREE DIMENSIONS
CHAPTER 10. LAGRANGIAN MECHANICS

Chapters 5, 6 and 9 are probably the most important to understand, either because they're so packed with content, they're difficult, or both. Don't be fooled by the course description; although one of the questions on the final will be on Lagrangian mechanics, this chapter will barely be covered in class!

The textbook itself is pretty hard to follow. There are hundreds of equations per chapter, most of which will show up in the solutions. The author's also very long-winded.

Also, I'd recommend looking through any parts of the textbook that the professor decided to skip during lectures, because apparently he says it would be useful to know the content even if he didn't cover it!The professor kept on focusing on basic vectors and changing bases, but glossed over other significant details such as differential equations. If you're a second-year student and haven't taken PHYS2124 yet (or are taking it in the same semester as this course), this will be a problem. As a result, his pacing is very hard to follow.
Sometimes, however, the professor does provide some useful examples and explanations in class, so you could consider going to lectures. You could also ask him questions after class, but I found that he often didn't understand my questions.
Overall, though, I think that it would be more effective to self-study, and look for the TA if you have any questions.Really not enough content.
This course is intented to have a more broad coverage of analytical mechanics. However, it spent a lot of time on Kepler problem but only 1/3 of the total time on analytical mechanics, resulting a sudden stop after deriving the Hamilton equations and missing a lot of important content which would also be quite important in latter study like quantum mechanics.
You'd better learn something by yourself, while taking this course or when finding something needed in latter study, depending on your style. Maybe Goldstein's book is a good choice. You may find it in UST library.The teaching is fair.
Though a bit boring through the plain ppt teaching and some small issues, the professor presented the things clearly enough. The ppts are detailed, if my memory does not go wrong.Decent content, includes everything an introductory classical mechanics lecture needs to have. Topics include Newtonian Mechanics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, Rigid body problems.The instructor knows his stuff but it rather bad at delivering the content of the course. More often than not it was a better option not to attend the lecture as you tend to lose energy sitting in the classThe first few chapters are appropriate for a 2nd year course. Rotational Mechanics and Mechanics in non-inertial frames are introduced with a fair amount of rigor in the book. However in the lectures, the most important derivations and results are skipped. He instead spends time solving problems which should've been left to tutorials.  

Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics is barely touched. Ideally, these topics should've constituted an entire 3 Year course, instead they are taught in a rushed manner in the last 2-3 lectures.

Tutorial sections are good enough, the problems he chooses are sometimes from the book, but sometimes he discusses some advanced results not part of the course.

The book used is Analytical Mechanics by Fowles and Cassiday.The teaching is okay, he understands how a typical student's mind works and teaches accordingly. He often uses a whiteboard to solve problems or do derivations.This course requires a lot of math in solving the physics problems. The solutions to the problems are basically from solving differential equations, hence you need to be patient in solving those.Professor Han knows a lot in Physics but he fails to develop an engaging atmosphere for learningThis course is mainly about the "dirty" part of quantum mechanics because it is so hard that we have to apply approximation methods. Things like stationary state perturbation theory and the variational principle are taught to apply on hydrogen/helium atoms. The fine structure and the spectrum of hydrogen atom are taught as well but the course is without the WKB method. Refer to chapter 8 of Griffiths: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics 2nd Ed.

More things like emission and absorption of radiation, adiabatic approximation and geometric phase, scattering theory are taught after the mid-term exam.

Attached is a copy-and-paste of the Canvas page for the course syllabus.Prof. Leung is famous for his excellent way of teaching. He made this course simple by using different tools and similes to make his explanations clear;  I am still impressed by how he deployed a Chinese lantern to explain and simulate the lift in energy levels in the stationary state perturbation theory; He once curled up a piece of paper to explain what a solid angle is in a lecture of scattering theory.

He also made the math in this course easier to understand by telling stories or making jokes on it: He said 137 is not only the fine structure constant but also the room number in which Wolfgang Pauli passed away.

Sometimes he talked about his own story with other physicists like he missed the chance to meet Richard Feynman in the US, meanwhile teaching some extra knowledge about physics outside the scope of this course.

He would also make a quick review of the previous course PHYS3036 and linear algebra to refresh your memory.

Overall his teaching is really good but you have to pay close attention to what he says and writes on the board because he talks quite fast or else you will easily get confused.The content was deviated from the syllabus described in the description of the course. Apart from the content in Griffiths' textbook (no WKB though), he talked about many advanced topics in Shankar's textbook such as angular momentum and rotational invariance, Dirac equation, second quantization (somehow informal) and path integral. It can be quite hard to many students, but one passionate in Physics, especially QM would definitely enjoy his course. In my opinion, it helped me so much in other further studies. Finally he also introduced some basic concepts on solid state physics, as his advertisement to his solid state physics course.Prof Law is enthusiastic in teaching. He explained the content clearly, especially he emphasized some details ignored by the textbooks. He also intended to teach the concepts behind the theory instead of performing boring computations. He encouraged students to think more by asking questions very often in the lessons. In addition, I think he is a kind professor as he always answered my questions patiently after lessons. I also heard that a Year 1 student audited his course without application since the middle of the course, and Prof Law allowed him to join the final exam.In contrast to Prof. Leung's QM II, which focuses more on perturbation and other techniques to approximately solve QM problems, Prof. Law's one focuses much more on the detailed theories and some more advanced stuffs, owning to his theoretical solid states background. There are:

1. A revisit of angular momentum and spin (Shankar Ch. 12, 14 and 15)
2. Dirac equation
3. Time-independent and dependent perturbation theory, with typical applications like fine structure and helium atom
4. Quantization of electromagnetic field (not included in final exam)
5. Scattering
6. Berry phase
7.  Feynman's path integralProf. Law is an enthusiastic teacher about the subject and is willing to talk to students at length after class to address their questions or know about their situations. Being a theoretician, he also attempted to introduce some of the more underlying theories behind, most notably the angular momentum as a generator of rotation, and other advanced topics like Dirac equation and path integral.

Since he does not distribute any notes, you will need to jot notes yourselves. Luckily, he speaks quite slowly that it should not be difficult (and jotting notes do really help understanding the mathematics behind)

And by the way, prepare for lots of advertisements about his Solid State IIThis course covers the basic computational tools to do calculations for physics problems. Content:

1. Integral & Derivatives
2. Linear & Non Linear Equations
3. ODE
4. PDE

Be sure to attend lectures and copy everything that he writes on the whiteboard

WARNING: He would test students on what he teach during the lectures and those are not included in the lecture notes. So be sure to copy them or have someone to copy it for youDr Choy is passionate in teaching. Although he can't speak very fluent English, but he tries to make everything clear to everybody. He would keep reminding us about the date of our exams and to bring the scientific calculator for the exams. It would be a disaster if you do not have a calculator for the exam.The course includes four chapters: integration & derivative; linear & non-linear equation; ODE; PDE. This is a mandatory course for physics major students, and its contents are useful for computational techniques.The instructor likes to use whiteboard to write notes (concepts, examples, etc.) so it is a good idea to take your own notes. You can basically cope with all assignments and exams using his notes without extra effort. It was a pity that he got sick at the end of the semester so the last part of PDE was not taught (but he offered a make-up lecture after the final exam). Hope the pace of the lecture could be a bit faster.The content of this course is very useful for any physics student. Standard techniques of numerical analysis such as various computational methods in integration, solving non linear equations, differential equations etc. is covered. The course modules are accompanied by lab work which is very useful to gain familiarity with these methods.Dr. Choy is very systematic and provides excellent notes summarizing what has been covered in class. If you want more depth it is wise to attend his lectures. More often than not it's what's covered in class that appears in the exams.Coulomb’s law, electric field and potential, Gauss’ law, capacitance, circuits, magnetic force and field, Ampere’s law, electromagnetic induction, AC circuit, Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic waves, geometric optics, interference and diffraction.

If you have taken Physics as an elective in HKDSE, this course can be seen as an enhanced version.Many proofs(will not test in exams) in lectures with some interesting demos.

Professor Choy may be good at physics, but not in teaching...
He appreciated discussion with students, and welcomes any questions. A little difficult in listening his pronunciation. And always overrun the time.

Many lectures are provided, just copy form the textbook...Topics include: Electrostatics, Dielectrics and Capacitance, DC Circuits, Magnetostatics, Electromagnetic Induction, Inductance, RLC Circuits, AC Circuits, Electromagnetic Waves, Propagation of Light, Interference, Diffraction

This course covered quite a wide range of topics (from electricity to magnetism to circuits to EM waves) with many concepts new to me.

Luckily we were allowed one A4 sized cheat sheet in the midterm and final exam (which was cumulative.)

I thought circuits were the hardest part of this course, particularly those involving capacitors and inductors - something I had never encountered before.

Also, I spent some time on Gauss's law and Ampere's law as both are conceptually and mathematically demandingI never really went to class but I have heard that his lectures were neither good nor bad, but they did include some interesting demonstrations.E&M stuff, a bit difficult for students who have no physics background.Professor Leung's lecture is REALLY FUNNY AND INTERESTING, he had effectively explain the course material to us and brought us joy in the lectures even though those stuff are a bit difficult. If you wish to have a more enjoyable physics lecture, then I think professor Leung's lecture would be a good choice for you.The content is interesting and well structured. It's a bit lengthy and hence, some sections of the textbook will be not be covered in the course which is good. The content requires some basic knowledge integral calculus.I somehow managed to sleep in most of the lectures. If I were to stay awake, I believe that professor is decent. He puts effort into the notes and explanations. The TA I got was sub-par. His English was confusing. Otherwise, I mostly self-studied this course.It is basically the M&E and some diffraction for topics. I think most students will have some knowledge on the topics already before taking the class. You have to buy textbook because it contains online assignmentThe professor is really specific on topics and the lecture slides are super helpful(if you have the textbook that will be better since it is just the copy of the textbook)An enhanced version of E&M, and wave.Actually, around 30% of the content has been discussed in DSE syllabus.

PS very small part overlaps with ELEC1100, kirchhoff’s loop rule and capacitorLecture notes are clear and easy to understand. some question in the notes are copied from the textbook so you can find the answer in the book or in the powerpoint uploaded to the canvas.

The Professor is nice and welcome students to ask him questions. It's ok to ask him in Cantonese. This makes me easier to understand the concepts.

But still, instead of lectures, I mainly learnt things through notes and MasPhy.students have to get familiar with the difficult E&M in one semester, it's quite tough for me except for those excel in physics.prof Leung is a great teacher that you  can chat with him after class for a long long time. Of course it should be about physics!As what i saw, a lot students surrounded prof leung after class, talking about physics. but pof leung teaches the basic version of e&m, most of the contents you can find on textbook. if you want to learn deeper or advanced physics you should join prof Chen or Lin class, or even phy 1314.Basically E&M and optics, with the use of calculus. However, quite a few topics from optics are cancelled due to the long syllabus. Besides, the calculus is very easy that you can solve it without too many techniques as taught in 1013/1012.Dr. Choy is a nice guy with great physics knowledge. However, it is a bit difficult to concentrate in class due to his English. If you can speak Cantonese, you could ask him after class and that would be fine. But for non-Cantonese speaker, it is a bit pity.
For the lecture notes he used, they were just summary of the book(dun bother to read the book) and most of them are easy to follow(except the last chapter which it had skipped so much detail and proof).The course teaches about Electricity, Magnetism and optics.
The other reviews are accurate and thus will be skipped.
Note that this course uses calculus a lot more than PHYS 1112, and vector cross/dot product will be taught. Thus it is highly suggested to review contents from MATH1012/1013.He has a very good understanding of physics and is able of answering your questions. However, he teaches by just reading the powerpoint.EM and Light phenomena
EM PART:
Electrostatics, circuit( LRC, RC, LR..)

Magnetism ;
Biot-Savart Law/ Lorentz Force/Amperes' law/Faraday's Law/ EM wave/ AC current with LRC,RC,LC Circuit

Light;
Interference/ diffaction

In AC current part, I strongly suggest to use complex number and Kirchhoff's rule to derive those circuits' formulae.Prof. Lin is a funny person ,he always smile in the class
He required the students to read the lecture notes before attending the class, but I didn't do it...
His teaching is good because he gave time to students to think about his questions in class. I think this method can stimulate students' mind in the class. However while you you are thinking his questions, you MUST write down in a blank paper. Besides, he always walk around the classroom while you are solving question.
He always perform some experiments in the lecture , so , if you like experiments , take it.It is all about electricity, wave and optical. The basic concepts of the content have been studied in secondary school. You are required to have a deeper understanding and do more calculation. The most difficult parts for me are RLC circuit and Interference from a Thin Air Wedge. I think tutorials are very useful.He is funny. Some exercises are required to do in class. You need to read notes before classes. Otherwise, you may not be able to know what he is saying.Electric charge and electric field, Gauss Law, electrical potential, capacitance and dielectrics, currents and circuits, DC circuits, magnetic field and forces, Ampere's Law ,Maxwell equations, EM induction, AC current, inductance, EM wave, nature of light, interference and diffraction

The contents are generally interesting. Basic differentiation and integrations skills, as well as some 3-D graphical sense(?) are expected.Prof. Leung can make the hardest physics concepts in this course as easy to understand as 'kindergarten level'(he likes using this phrase)...This is an exaggeration of course, but he teaches extremely well and we can naturally focus on his teaching and grasping the concepts without significant difficulty. Don't use smartphones or being late on his lessons or else he will ask you questions(and embarrass you even though he questions are directly related to the topics)Topics include: Electrostatics, Dielectrics, and Capacitance, DC Circuits, Magnetostatics, Electromagnetic Induction, Inductance, RLC Circuits, AC Circuits, Electromagnetic Waves, Propagation of Light, Interference, Diffraction

That's a wide range of topics related to E&M, It's quite interesting and useful in some way.Prof. Leung is a local instructor, and he is the best science instructor I have ever seen as a year one student. He encourages students to think more, answering the question and asking the encourage as well. He can answer every question that the students asked and may discuss more after the lecture.

Prof. Leung can explain the concepts in a quite detail way and he did try to let the students get the intuition through his teaching. Which is not really duck feeding and don't encourage you to remember all the equations just for the exam.General physics level electricity and magnetism + interference and diffraction for this semester (Contents vary every semester. Please check which ones are omitted/included).

I recommend reading the course reference (University Physics by Freedman) and Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday. Interested students can also read Electricity and Magnetism by Purcell (some problems are good, but some other problems toward the end, which seems to be added later on by the second writer, are infuriating to read + strangely worded, and seems to be made by a non-physicist.) or Introduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths for fun. However, the two references mentioned in the beginning should be more than enough.Overall the teaching was ok.

The professor does address all the course syllabus and which ones are to be excluded for the semester. He may also note whether the contents in his lecture notes will appear in the exams. However, attending the lectures was very inefficient as professor Leung spent most of the time (including the lecture notes) solving examples/talking about contents directly copied from the textbook.

Professor Leung does not give adequate explanations. For instance, he mentioned the direction of a field is uniquely defined by symmetry, but he does not explain why it is so. The concept is in fact abstract and not that intuitive after all. In such cases, it is a good idea to ask questions immediately, as there can be too many people asking the professor after the class.

As a side note, he seems to believe in the survival of the fittest. To quote "Do not sit next to people who cannot answer your question".A lot of slides include some proofs (textbook doesn't teach), which make student easier understand.

Every lecture would demonstrate 1-2 experiments related to that topic.He is an expert in EM. He can answer students very clearly and with  patient. And, he would like to encourage students to ask him questions even though those are not EM questions.

He also would like to share U-Life about himself and give some advises to students how you can study well.

He is hong konger so you can ask question with Cantonese.

You will love him after summer semester.Continuation of PHYS 1111/1112 (General Physics I). Topics include:
Electric Charge and Field
Gauss's Law
Electric Potential
Capacitance and Dielectrics
Current, Resistance, and EMF
Direct-Current Circuits
Magnetic Field and Forces
Electromagnetic Induction
Inductance
Alternating Current
Electromagnetic Waves
Nature and Propagation of Light
Interference
Diffraction

The level of difficulty is quite high in my opinion as each topic is covered in depth and even if you have studied these topics in high school they are quite different in this course. Calculus is used in the explanations and examples but is not really necessary to solve the problems in the exams.Prof. Ng is a great teacher. He explains all the concepts carefully and step-by-step, making sure that all the students understand and is always willing to help with any doubts or problems. The lectures can sometimes get a bit boring but he tries to maintain the interest and is quite funny. The lecture slides are all uploaded online but I think it's very important to attend because you need to understand the concepts and how to use them to solve problems, not just memorize the slides.Electromagnetism and photonics. Important for ELEC3600 and 2400.

DiffractionI heard that Prof. YANG, Zhi Yu taught well.The content mainly in EM and optics.
In the EM part, some of laws in Phys1112 about torque and force will be used but not much.
The lecturer will visit the laws again ( but not in detail) so you may need to revise the previous course.
Don't depend on your DSE Physics. It is completely in different levels and you are an expert in DSE Physics doesn't mean you can skip class in Phys1114. (Especially after midterm, the optics part)The teaching methods is better than the honor counterpart Phys1314.
The teacher will teach more about the laws and he will try to give you examples.
There are also some demonstration in the lectures so it won't be too boring.
But the curriculum is actually too much for a semester course and the optics part may talk in a high speed. So maybe you can revise it first before lessons.Most topics are from HKDSE Physics
Need basic calculus knowledge
Good course to understand working principles of electronics

2.University physics
The focus in the exam is the university physics. Those things you have already learnt in secondary school will not save you.Don't need to attend the lectures and tutorials. The teaching is boring.But you can learn something more if you attend the lectures. The sound of the Prof. makes me sleepy. The tutorial is useless. The TA just substitutes the number into the formula without explanation.electric
magnetic
....No exam, no homework. You don't have to worry about this course. This is kind of break time. At the end of the course, you may take a photo with physics faculty members including PHYS 2080 students.It's such a long time ago, I don't remember at all, which means there are no such important stuff to remember.The course has diverse topics and really gives you a wonderful idea of how physics can fit into modern day finance. The topics are modified according to students' interests. Additional topics are included sometimes according to szeto's fancies.Good teaching, instructor can get sidetracked sometimes. He covers very simple algebra on the board if he thinks people are clueless.Interesting topic. Topics including signals, probability and decision theory, concepts like information entropy and game theory. We apply physics into finance and concepts like mean variance analysis portfolio management is teached.Clear teaching. But the powerpoint does not provide sufficient information for you to do the revision. So it will be good for you to attend classes and jot notes. Sometimes the material will be a bit scattered because Prof Szeto will teached by his interest. But not hard to understand.This course focuses heavily on problem solving and less on exploring theoretical concepts in detail. It moves at an extremely fast pace, and would be extremely hard to follow if you are not already aware of all the concepts being taught. I would suggest that only the following students take up this course:

-Have studied and are more than familiar with the content, and have used calculus thoroughly in problem solving in high school.

-Are genuinely interested in challenging themselves and are not here to get an easy A.

-Think they possess above average intelligence.

These are the necessary AND sufficient criteria for joining this course.

(Attendance isn't a requirement. So if you are an Olympiad gold medalist, go chill in the...library)Prof CHAN can be best described as being mediocre.

He had one flaw the existence of which, even though quite common, turned out to be disappointing.
He would randomly go about working on a problem without explaining the intent behind each step. I emphasize this, he would explain the 'reasoning', but not the 'intent' behind each step.

The teaching assistant barely made his presence felt except on days on which he would collect the written HW.Phys1312 is the harder edition for Phys1112. The questions it asked mainly for proof and so it is quite hard in normal student level.
So if you are not very keen to challenge yourself, dont take this course.Ho Ban is a good teacher. He will explain clearly to you if you ask him and also, he will make jokes without smiling.
That makes the jokes even more interesting haha.Contents nearly all the knowledge in the high school physics competition.Also very useful for those physics http://learners.It can make such a fundamental knowledge level and help to grab further ones.Students may clearly know what prof. are saying, though,actually, sometimes the conditions may not classified so clearly.1_Physical Quantities, dimensional analysis and Vectors
2_Motion in 2D
3_Newton's Laws of Motion
4_Work and Kinetic Energy
5_Potential Energy & Energy Conservation
6_Momentum, Impulse and Collision
7_Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
8_Angular Momentum
9_Gravitation
10_Periodic Motion
11_Wave Motion and Sound
12_Temperature and Heat
13_Thermal Properties of Matter
14_First Law of Thermodynamics
15_Second Law of ThermodynamicsAcceptable, but sometimes his explanation does not make sense. Then you have to study the relevant content by yourself and search for some other materials. The professor will give some written notes each class for a supplement of his lecture notes. Since his handwriting is not good, you really need to concentrate in each class in order to understand what he wrote... Tutorials are necessary as he will also give lectures in the tutorials.There are a lot of topics to be covered in this course. I have some friends studying PHYS in HKU and basically what I learnt from this course are more or less the same as what he has learnt in 2 years.

Unlike ordinary HKDSE PHYS, you cannot simply plug the equations like v=u+at. In this course, it involves a lot more calculus. From Mechanics to Wave, more intensive syllabus is covered like the parallel axis theorem and damping.Prof. Chan has the best spoken English ability in the Science School I think. Although he did not really explain very well the intent and intuition, his steps and other explanations are kinda useful. Yet, don't expect to ask via email cuz his answers are kinda short there. TA is good tho (should be Patrick).This course is a kind of expansion of PHYS1112 and the main topics covered by these two courses are overall same, except that PHYS1312 focuses more on formula deduction. If you are curious about how the formula come out rather than simply remembering them, PHYS1312 is worthy to try.I think the professor is trying his best to usher us into fantastic physics world. His passion to physics is undoubted, and I believe he brings this passion to teaching as well. Before each class, we can get access to PPT in Canvas, and professor uses the pad to write down notes and projects on screen, and releases notes on Canvas after class. So on class you can more focus on catching on the content rather than rushing to finish your own note.A more advanced version of PHYS1112. Some people may find PHYS1112 too easy but PHYS1312 too difficult, so it is up to you to decide which path you want to take. The difficulty goes up gradually during the course and the finals was very challenging, even though some students can still achieve 49/50 which was unbelievable. You learn about basic mechanics (linear motion, simple harmonic motion, gravitation...), rotational motion (moment of inertia, rotational energy, angular momentum...) and thermodynamics (heat engine, 0th/1st/2nd law of thermodynamics, heat exchange...), just like PHYS1112. However, calculus knowledge is a prerequisite and there are additional techniques you have to learn.Very good teaching. Prof Chan writes his own notes during the lesson and teaches stuff out of the powerpoint. He shows the steps very clearly so you can follow them easier. There are some demos in lessons and he even inhaled Helium one time. There are iPRS questions every lesson which allows you to check your own understanding.

Prof Chan also takes time after lessons to answer students' queries and he points out the common mistakes in students' homework.Covering basic newtonian mechanics, waves and thermodynamics. A more in-depth version when compared to PHYS1112, with more use in calculus to explain some physics concepts or calculations.Professor Chan is one of the best instructor I have met in HKUST. He explains all physics concepts very clearly, and he has some written lecture slides which assist his teaching. It is easy for students to revise after lecture if we cannot catch up any parts of the lecture. He is also willing to answer any questions that you have regarding the course content.
It is also worth-mentioning that he does many interesting demos himself and he holds the tutorial himself, which shows his enthusiasm in teaching.The content is similar to PHYS 1112. However it demands more from students. In addition to all the knowledge from PHYS 1112, students have to integrate calculus into the computations. Thus the content becomes much harder. Instead of solving generic questions, students have to solve fundamental proof-type questions with very less numbers and more variables. This is a very nice course as students get to learn Physics in very nice depth.In my opinion, Professor Chan, Ho Bun is a very organized professor. His lectures are easy to follow. He goes over assignments after they are handed in. Moreover he gives us tips for the challenging assignment and examination questions. He gives students encouragement even if they aren't doing too well. He does call on students to answer questions in class.Syllabus:
- Physical quantities, dimensional analysis, vectors
- Motion in 2D
- Newton'w laws
- Work and Energy
- Momentum, impulse and collision
- Dynamics of rigid bodies
- Angular momentum
- Gravitation
- Periodic motion
- Wave motion and sound
- Temperature
- Thermal properties of matter
- First & Second law of thermodyanmics

The syllabus contains more contents than PHYS1112 and they are more in-depth, you would love to take this course if you want to have a greater understanding in physics (esp. in motion, wave & heat)

The exam is more harsh than the standard one, apart from MCs (which are the only question type in PHYS1112), we have long questions, with difficulties similar to the written homework.Prof. Chan is one of the best professors I have met in HKUST. He is very passionate in teaching and is willing to answer any sort of questions after lecture. We typically keep him for 30 minutes more after lecture to ask our question :P
One thing I would like to mention is the atmosphere of the classroom, among classmates we sometimes talk about the written problems and questions we have during lectures, and truthfully this is the only course yet that I have the opportunity to experience such a nice learning atmosphere. It might be true that all honour courses have a similar atmosphere as well.PHYS 1312 basically covers the same topics of PHYS 1112, with a bit more in-depth discussion in topics like simple harmonic motion, waves, etc. You will need a lot more calculus in proving stuff in 1312 than 1112, and questions you are going to encounter are proof-based.

The first half semester will cover basic mechanics learnt in DSE/ high school with some differentiation and integration. You will learn some new stuff in the second half semester such as simple harmonic motion, wave equation, Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion, gravitation and thermodynamics. Personally, I found those latter topics more difficult.Professor Chan is a REALLY nice professor and we can tell he is really into teaching his fellow students. He is good at drawing pictures and diagrams to illustrate theorems. He also stayed behind to answer a bunch of questions from the hard-working Chinese.Very fundamental physics lesson. The course contains Newtown mechanics and little thermology. The teaching contains mathematic prove and experiment. IT'S BETTER TO LEARN CALCULUS BEFORE TAKE THIS COURSE. Because many methods need math. The course does't take attendance but has PRS questions (will not be graded).Prof CHAN is very nice. He did all experiments himself and some are quite dangerous. The most important thing is that he cares us very much. He gave a pathway for students who want to do more on physics. I got a chance to talk with him face in face and got much experience.The content that was taught in the course is basically the same as PHYS 1112 but exam and homework is harder.Prof. Chan taught really good and if having any question, you can just ask him after the lecture and he will answer all the questions, sometimes he was stuck there for more than half an hour.This course is about basic idea of dynamics , sound and heat. Compared to phys 1112, their content are similar, but phys 1312's exams has some difficult long questions.I think the professor is excellent. Even the tutorial section he taught in person. And he did many demonstrations this term, which were very interesting and inspiring.It is a good course for those who want to take physics as  their major in the future.There are not too many new topics,but the professor will teach you some new approaches to solving physics http://problem.It is recommended to those who do not join any physics Olympics but want to study physics in the future .The professor is good at teaching and he is willing to answer any students' questions. Sometimes he stays behind after the lectures and answers students' question.Not really different from the textbook (except for the parts that are stated not to be included, e.g. fluid mechanics), the 1112 course, or the IPhO Hong Kong training (except for noninertial frames, which are not included). Teaching pace normal. Methods normal.Any professor willing to inhale helium in class deserves an A.This syllabus of this course is similar to PHYS 1112, except there is more proof of theorems and there are some extra topics which are mainly for enrichment, including:
1. Projectiles on Inclined Plane
2. Tension of a String With Finite Mass Undergoing
    Circular Motion
3. Bowling Ball Problem, e.t.c.

This course will require a very good foundation of calculus skills. In addition, some higher level of Mathematical skills, such as solving O.D.E. and Taylor expansion, will also be used. So do not choose this course just for seeking better grades, you will suffer if your Maths skills are not good enough.Professor Chan is a very good professor who knows clearly on the topics in 1312. The lecture notes are very clear and arranged well. He also uses a writing pad in class to demonstrate some of the proofs and also some extra problems related to the topic taught at the moment with clear indication of the flow of his logic. This allows students to easily follow his idea. Moreover, he is also very willing to answer students' questions, even the question might be really 'strange'. So if you have attended his lecture, don't hesitate to ask any questions if you want to.

The TA is also very helpful especially in providing some ideas on how to solve the written and online homework, however you can hardly feel his existence because he only shows up in the days of collecting written homework and demonstration.The course contains from basic mechanics to thermodynamics. I think it's a lot for only one semester.Professor Chan is very interesting. He knows his stuff, I can sometimes see him reading physics related materials on his tablet while having dinner in lg7. He always tell us not to give up because this course is much harder than what he did in Princeton.The content is similar to PHYS 1112 however, the professor will emphasize more on some concepts that are quite useful in solving problems. The methods that he teach will be useful during the exams as if you understand it, you can straight away apply it and get full marks.Professor Chan is a very good professor, he is one of my best one. He is willing to teach and does interesting demonstrations during the lectures. He is willing to answer our questions and also concern about our future selection of courses. (He made a sample for the physics major course selection for the four year program which helps a lot to me.) He is cold from his looks but he is warm from beneath.Content is not so hard if you jave some Olympiad student background. It will cover the normal physics topics in more detailed way.Teaching is quite good, instructors organization of notes is amazing and well-developed. If you will listen, you should understand the topic without any hardship.Grading also not bad. If you work hard and do your assignments you will surely get B range. And you should show a commitment.Workload is a bit higher from normal. But it is manageable. Especially online HW will take your time.Quite good, not much different with PHYS1112 actually, except that we need to do long questionTeaching is good, the instructor will write course note on his tablet and upload to the web which make life much easier.mean is A range, but given that if you can get a A range in 1112 doesn't mean you can get mean in this course.. There is a hard competition, DSE students are at a disadvantage if you didn't study extra things on your own.

Mid term below 0.7 SD
Final below 1.5 SD
HW almost full
B-Mastering physics and long questions(written, can take a long of time if you are not smart enough) every week, exam is very close to HWNot many thing new. Just something taught in the high school and a little expansion in thermal partsHis teaching is good in all.
Very patient.
Comfortable pace.I think Grading is OK. Although I didn't get too much above mean, I still got an A. That is very good compared to MATH 1023. Maybe it is because i have done all the homework?Workload is very big although it really helps to understand the content.
There is homework online and we need to hand in homework once a week.
The written homework is difficult.
But the final is even more difficultSame syllabus as PHYS1112.
Long questions in exams are mutated versions of homework problems.I think he's quite scary sometimes when he calls out students' names and asks questions......
But overall his teaching is clear and direct, plus the class is quiet, so you get a good learning environment.Intro mechanics and a little bit of thermodynamics.

As the course introduction suggest, some of the content might get a little bit deeper than the normal general physics course, but nothing is really difficult, and the whole course follows closely to the textbook (that being said, the course will finish that whole thick book in about 3 month, so be careful about the pace you study).

Here's my sincere advice:

You might have already learnt most of the material being taught in this course, but even so please be sure you at least review a little as the course goes.

Personally, this is like my 3rd or 4th time studying these introductory stuff, and I choose to do so simply for the sake of getting an easy A. So I must confess, I was just too unmotivated to even bother about studying. But apparently I am not familiar enough with those intro things to have all of them still staying in my head after two years, adding to that, some of the material was covered a little deeper than what I used to learn the first time. And that really did got me. It ended up, you know, I got nowhere near an A, and I really regret it.

So, do work hard if you choose PHYS1312.I can tell Prof. Chan really did try his best to teach, and he did try to give a satisfactory answer to every single question asked by the student.

But still, honestly, the lecture can get fairly boring, and I just never think teaching physics with PowerPoint is a good idea.Course covers basic classical mechanics/wave/thermodynamics contents. Overall, aside from a few special techniques, this is just a harder version of PHYS1112.Prof. Chan's teaching is quite good. He usually demonstrates some of the problem solving techniques needed on his notepad when necessary to help the students follow. The lectures also consist of some live demonstrations, one of them being Prof. Chan singing after inhaling some Helium gas.Professor did very good in teaching. The content of this course is very useful but a little difficult. However, it is worth taking PYHS1312, it's really a good practice of your mind and logical thinking method.Professor did very good in teaching. The content of this course is very useful but a little difficult. However, it is worth taking PYHS1312, it's really a good practice of your mind and logical thinking method.Considering the fact that the term is really short, the content of the course is quite adequate. It covers the basic knowledge about most of the mechanics part of general physics with some simple application of calculus, but lack techniques of thinking and calculating, which cause this course far easier than I expected. I have to point out that some details was omitted and may cause the incompleteness of the knowledge net of students. However, now that the exam would not cover this sort of details, then we can just learn what we need to know and get a grade.Professor CHAN is a good man with a clear string of instructing. He can explain every element in his class and he would be willing to solve any problem for any student. By combining experiment in class, video and his tiny writing pad, he could show what he wanted us to know clearly without ambiguity, You would get all what he want to express easily with his good ability of instructing.I think this is good class  to learn. Maybe hard, but worth. I enjoy it a lot. I hope I can get good grade.I think this is good class  to learn. Maybe hard, but worth.I enjoy it a lot. I hope I can get good grade.I think this is good class  to learn. Maybe hard, but worth.I enjoy it a lot. I hope I can get good grade.I think this is good class  to learn. Maybe hard, but worth.I enjoy it a lot. I hope I can get good grade.Just the same as PHYS1112
About 70% of the content has already been taught in high school like, only a few topics are new like:
rotational motion, elasticity, simple harmonic motion, thermodynamics, etc.
Calculus is mentioned in lectures but will not be tested or expected. Overall they are not very difficult but might need some time to understand or digest.
The final exam paper was just like DSE exam paper.Dr. Ng tried to explain everything clearly and slowly but it seemed to be too slow. It was very easy to fall asleep in class. He is willing to answer questions.
(But I even don't know what I don't know and do know until doing the online questions)
There were some experiments after lectures, they were quite interesting and helpful to learn more.

Nothing weird in this course. No calculus background needed.The instructor is kind and is always trying to make the class interesting (but fails as not many people is listening to him). The teaching speed is acceptable.
The tutorial classes may be a little boringbefore midterm:
90% are taught in your secondary school
only the identification of static friction and kinetic friction is newly taught. you can just skip all lectures and only attend tutorial if you want some exercise.
after midterm:
many new concept are introduced like rotational motion with acceleration of angular speed, harmonic motion and some thermodynamics law. quite simple, tho.I seldom skipped lectures tho they are unnecessary and they dont take attendance. Professor Cheung talk with a largethic tone and poor pronounciation. But he is always willing to explain physics idea if you think you are not sure about the concepts.

really boring lectures
mostly doing my own stuff

exercises discussed in the tutorials is close to the question asked in the exam. and if you really dont have time, theres online copy of the tutorial noteson canvas.the main physics topic which also covered in the DSE: Heat, wave, motion. The concepts are not too different comparing with the high school, but with a few mathemsticsl concept applied in the teachingDr. Cheung has a passion to teach with powerpoint and a lot of experiments/ video demonstrations are included during lectures. But he always turn the lights into very dimmed and a lot of students are easy fall a sleep

Tutorial session: no attendance taken. The TA will pick some question from the textbook as demo. She will get some time for us to think and do by ourselves then she will write down the steps and explain further.PHYS1111 targets students who have learned the most basic knowledge in physics in high school. Most of the topics has been taught in high school, which include mechanics, periodic motion, waves, and fluids, thermal dynamics. You need to buy a textbook or a code for online assignments.Professor Ng teaches very slowly but the concepts are clearly explained in detail. At the end of the lesson, sometimes there will be TA coming in to perform experiments that are related to the content which make the concepts clearer and more understandable.
There is a revision class conducted by the TA which points out all the important things you have to study in order to prepare for the exam. There's some tips too.
Tutorial classes do help. You will do some difficult questions from the online assignment and extra practice exercises to help you familiarize yourself with the type of questions. The practice questions are quite similar to the questions in final exam.Motions along a Straight Line (2) •

Second Law of Thermodynamics (16)Bad: Actually quite boring as Dr. Cheung just read out powerpoint. Always turn off the light so I always sleep. He finishes one difficult chapter in just one lesson at last.
Good: Willing to answer you patiently when you got questions (by email/ in person); will discuss career with you <I am an only accounting student in this course>

TA is rubbish and lazy. Once I ask him questions, he just says not fair to other students if answer me.  Therefore I give him one out of five in teaching survey.This course is the without-calculus version of PHYS 1112, so it is easier. A large part of the content is included in HKDSE Physics. There are new topics that aren't taught in high school, but as calculus isn't included in this course, they are just more or less of similar difficulty as DSE.

-The Second Law of ThermodynamicsDr. Ng is very nice, friendly and willing to answer questions from students. And he explains things clearly.Half the content is about dse physics the other half would be new topic the power point contains many details and it is time-consuming to read the power point  better study the power point before the lecture so that you can follow the classboring

boringThe content is very similar to PHYS 1112, but you will study less amount of chapters in this class. Mostly, you just need to recall your knowledge in physics based on what you have studied in high school. The difficulty level might be higher but it is still manageable if you study hard. For textbook, you do not need to buy the new one. There is no online quizzes or assignments.The instructor is very nice and he can easily recognize our faces. He has a good English pronunciation, easy-to-understand lecture and presentations, also really helpful if we have any question regarding his teaching materials. However, he really likes to put difficult questions for mid-term and final exam; you cannot find these questions on textbook (it is like he tries to combine the knowledge from several chapters into one question). You need to practise a lot and try to understand everything, not just remember the questions on textbook.The course is mainly about the general physics calssical part(like the Newtonia force, motion, rotation...) all the knowledge is fundamental, and at the end of semester, students may require to give a presentation in a unit of goup in front of the whole class.A good professor.The course is mainly about the general physics calssical part(like the Newtonia force, motion, rotation...) all the knowledge is fundamental, and at the end of semester, students may require to give a presentation in a unit of goup in front of the whole class.A good professor.The experiments in this lab is designed to complement the materials taught in PHYS 2022. These include:
-Measuring the speed of light
-Blackbody Radiation
-Electrical conductivity in solids
-The photoelectric effect
-Measurement of charge to mass ratio of an electron
-Measuring the de Broglie wavelength of an electron
-Balmer Series
-Radioactive decayNo CommentThe experiments quite related to the course, which is a usual practice, but the questions it asked in pre-lab don't really being taught in the lessons and you need to find answer in the lab manual or even in website.The IAs are quite nice in my sessions and they are quite helpful.
They will answer your questions though you will more or less being deducted marks by the TAs.Three tutorial sessions (attendance is not not mandatory) in the first three weeks combined with the actual lab sessions that also begin in the first week of the semester:

Tutorial sessions (Professor Wang):
1. Course Syllabus
2. Scientific Graphing & Data analysis
3. Guideline for Lab Report+Summary

Lab sessions (TAs and IA):
1.Direct Measurement of the Speed of Light (two weeks)
2.Blackbody Radiation (two weeks)
3.Electrical Conduction in Solids (one week)
4.Photoelectric Effect (one week)
5.Charge-to-Mass Ratio of the Electron (one week)
6.Electron Diffraction (one week)
7.The Balmer Series of Hydrogen (one week)
8.Radioactive Decay and Radiation Absorption (one week)

Some of the pre-lab questions are poorly designed and are not related to the contents of the lab.Students only get to see the TA and the IA during the lab. There is essentially no teaching as the course was designed for students to explore and get a conceptual feel of the principles in modern physics by themselves. In the beginning of each lab, the TA will spend about 5 minutes to note some points to consider. However, most of the time his English will be incomprehensible (I could barely understand a thing from the TA throughout the semester). He sometimes even speaks in Mandarin if he does not know the English words. It is therefore suggested to ask the IA for help if the assigned TA is not a fluent English speaker.

Professor Wang actively responds to questions during the tutorials, so it will be good to attend the tutorial sessions if the students have not taken/audited PHYS1113/PHYS1115.In the normal classes, it basically teaches the first 5 chapters of Griffiths Introduction to Quantum Mechanics(except quantum statistics and Bloch's theorem)

In the honor lectures, advanced topics like the concepts of symmetries and transformations, CG coefficients are taught. These may not be the things that would appear in QM II but something fundamental in the rigorous development of Quantum Mechanics. For those who want to pursuit their PhD in Physics, I strongly recommend them to take this honor course.Prof. Leung is a great teacher. QM becomes understandable and makes sense under his teacher. But beware! You cannot use any electronic devices during lectures.Basic quantum mechanics concept, review of classical mechanicsThe course is split into two part. The 3036 part is taught by Prof. Chan. His teaching is quite clear, but not so interesting. Prof. Leung teaches the 3037 part. He is a humorous professor while he can also explain the concept clearly.The content is just the same as PHYS 3036, but the tutorial class becomes an extra lecture given by Prof. Leung. The topics are including analytical mechanics, symmetries, canonical quantization, Heisenberg and Schrodinger pictures, and angular momentum.Prof. Leung is a very good teacher. You will not want to skip his class since presentation is very clear and he has sense of humor.
You better go to learn some Buddhism(but not related to quantum Buddhism) before you take this course because there is a lot of metaphor from Buddhism!

!!!CAUTION!!!
Don't use electronic in the class!The course covers the content taught in PHYS 3036 (First half of Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by David J Griffiths) as well as some additional content specifically for the Honors course.

The additional content includes Neother's theorem, canonical quantization, the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics and addition of angular momentum.Professor Leung is an incredible instructor. Unlike a certain classical mechanics instructor, Professor Leung clearly puts effort into teaching his students. He always takes the time to answer students' questions mid-lecture to ensure that everyone follows what he is teaching. He also tries to guide students through lengthy mathematics to aid students who are lacking in that particular aspect.

His exams and quizzes focuses more on understanding rather than calculations. If a student performs poorly (<20%) on the midterm, Professor Leung will personally talk to the student to see if he can help the student in any way.The course covers some basic material science topics. While it is a PHYS3000 course, there is a good reason why no pre-requisite is required for this course--you really can go into this course with just basic high school science knowledge and understand most of the content.
The course covers the following:
-Bonding
-Crystal structures, lattice position/direction/plane, plane/linear density
-Dislocation, defects
-Diffusion
-Stress/strain, deformation and elastic modulus
-Phase, phase diagram, microstructure of solid solution, eutetic structure, etc.
-Composite materials and their properties
-Energy levels and energy band, piezoelectrics
-Thermal expansion and conductivity
-Some magnetic propertiesProf. Wen's teaching is quite good...assuming you can understand his English. You will probably end up missing around quite a lot of the content as his English can be rather hard to understand at times. He tries to discuss with the students about how to apply some of the concepts in real life, and ask students to give predictions to results. Overall, it will help with learning the course quite a bit. And since he really does not follow whatever textbook he is using closely, I recommend attending the lessons to see what he is teaching.This course covers all basic aspects of material science including Young's modulus, phase diagram, conductivity and smart material etc.. (Textbook: Materials Science And Engineering An Introduction). However, the course mainly covers the qualitative aspect of those topics and quantitative calculation is rarely covered, which is rather disappointing for a student willing to understand material science in-depth.The teaching is not bad - if you could understand his English.
Professor writes down all the things on the board and you have to copy it as he will not upload them to the web. The professor tries to encourage students to participate the lesson by offering students additional points when answering questions. This is a good practice but the professor seems to forget it toward the end of the semester.I don't know why nobody is writing review for this very famous course. It is about introductory material science, talking about things like unit cells (FCC, BCC, etc.) and other things related to material science in an almost maths-free manner (only simple maths with simple equations included). The content is easy yet really interesting.No lecture notes available online at all. What you have to do is to attend the class and jot down the notes. The professor's English and Cantonese and Mandarin are very much a huge disaster, and you will understand why once you attend his class for the first time. But this does not make his teaching any worse. All in all, the teaching is easy to understand.No calculation at all

Professor will speed up after the midterm so catch up
Don't miss any class after midterm, you will regret ( even I went to every class I still can't get some of his point since he taught too fast.  For example, he finished 90 slides in one lectureThe course is solely dependent on Power Point slides. There is no supplementary reference suggested by the course.

There are consistent minor errors in the PPT slides. Insufficient explanations are given during the lectures towards the end of course due to limited time. Sometimes the questions on PRS are not clearly stated (or has implicit connections to the materials on the PPT). Some contents on PPT are ambiguously written, irritating to read.

No supplementary reference is suggested by the professor. It is understandable that the summer term is short and the course must proceed at a fast pace, but the professor should not directly copy online Pearson teaching materials (minimal modifications) and test bank questions. Self-Test questions are also pathetically copied from the test bank. Students therefore may have to depend on external learning resources in order to fully understand the contents.Professor Chen rushes too much and constantly relies on PPT slides (because summer term is short, I suppose). However, he does pause and elaborate on the contents if they are important or bound to show up on the exams.

Because the professor did not major in astronomy, he sometimes may not be able to answer some questions from the students. However, he usually looks for the answers after class and informs the students either by email or during the next lecture. In terms of this, professor Chen is passionate about teaching.Course Outline

Not difficult. Midterm and final are MCs. Cheatsheet is very important.Follow the slides.The course follows the book religiously and covers a lot of ground.One of the best Professors at HKUST.

Really have to be fluent with multivariable calculus i.e. line, surface, volume integrals, divergence theorem, stokes theorem, taking curl and divergence of fields.

Topics include electrostatics, fields in matter, magnetostatics, magnetic fields in matter, and electrodynamics with the focus mainly on Maxwell's equations.A standard way of teaching, going through powerpoints for each topic. Shows several examples of solving problems related to the topic, and just covering all the key concepts that's required.

Though boring at times, explanations are adequate, but often requires students to revisit the topic through textbook in order to fully understand the concepts.The content is very very boring and crappy. Given the course name and topic, it could have been made much more interesting. They say "This course is about numbers" but well, the theory and numerical part don't seem to make sense together and the large class size and 3 professors teaching just ruins it. If you're looking to take this course for S&T SSC, you're probably better off taking ENGG 1150. Although the workload might be high, but from what I've heard, grading is lenient.The teaching is really really bad. The most boring lectures Ive ever attended. Not taught well at all. Most of the lectures are just reading out the slides without any meaning as such. Cant focus at all!Literally no physics involved. If you know how to multiply and divide units, you'll pass the course by just copying the equations onto your cheat sheet.

Probably the most boring course I'll ever take. I literally go in five minutes before the lecture ends to do the PRS question and leave.The first few lectures were unprepared. It made me lose interest in the course. It was so bad that sometimes we wouldn't even finish half a lecture before the time was up. It was also hard to understand the lecturers. I feel bad for the 350 other people in the hall. Must be hell.Absolutely boring topics covered. Too much of stats and data stuffed into the lecture slides that confuse and perplex when preparing for the exams. Relevancy or applications of the topics covered cannot be seen by most students, making the course content itself not very enjoyable to study.Lectures are hard to concentrate in, especially with the 3 professors' accents. Monotonous lectures in classes of 300+ students, best class to do anything except PHYS1003 for almost all students. A typical class comprises of either slides being simply read off word by word in class, or abstract concepts being explained without any mention in the lecture slides.L1:      Introduction to the course and Population Growth

L22:     Climate changeHis teaching is quite good compare to other lecturers, at least it is not boring as most of the physics courses.This course covers a lot of topics including energy consumption, fossil fuels, temperature and thermal energy, thermodynamics, heat engines, electricity, renewable energy. Not really a difficult course, just like liberal studies(LS), you should have some common knowledge and it is enough. Becasue in exam, it basically is about converting units. Although the lecture teach a lot of concepts, equations and principles, the short questions in the mid term and exam mainly about converting units. Really boring lectures but you shouldn't skip lectures because every lecture have 1-3 PRS questions.Bad teaching. All three lecturers directly read from the powerpoint. The most interesting part is the demonstration part (which is about 10 mins, not all of the lecture have it). Other part of lecture is very boring.Content are not hard in general but very wide. Main divided into thermodynamics, electricity, power generation and pollution. Have both simple equations and knowledge include, but as cheat sheet (2 A4 pages) is allowed, no need to memorize. But the making of cheat sheet is very painful. Sometimes have self reading material in the ppt but I read through them quickly.

There will be QRS before the end of each lecture, but it is just for extra 5% of the total grade.

But to be honest there is a great advantage for science or engineering student (or DSE students who took physics) to take the course, where most of the content are taught before.Very normal, not very good but not bad. But as the lecture took place at LTA, only part of the students are paying attention (not include me). There are some experiments during lecture to let u understand the teaching material (and to wake us up), but just a few of them.before midterm:
use of energy by human
fossil fuel
car
engine(thermodynamics)
air transport

after midterm:
lighting and power grid
embodied energy
nuclear energy
renewable energy(wind, solar, tidal, water, etc)
air pollution
global warming

Actually they are quite interesting.Actually, the content are quite interesting.
So, it would be good to attend their lecture.
There are some experiment in some lecture so that you wont sleep.Before midterm: Thermodynamics, engines and other non-related stuffs.
After midterm: Different kinds of renewable energy, with some overlapping with HKDSE physics E3 (Energy and Use of Energy).

As mentioned by the instructors, this is not a physics course, and I have to agree with that. If you are having regular physics learning at HKUST, do not expect to learn some physics knowledge. The course title 'energy and related environmental issues' is the only thing you can learn from this course, which does not look interesting/attractive.Probably one of the worst teaching ever. While you may hope to have at least an interesting lecture given the fact that there are 3 instructors, the answer is no. Their pronunciations are not very good, and you may not wish to listen to their teaching, especially if you are having this course at 9am. If there is no iPRS counting as extra credits, I wonder if there is anyone going to the lessons. Simply reading the lecture notes is enough as their teaching does not matter a lot in the exams.
Nevertheless, the IA of this course is quite good and he does some good demos during the lectures.The contents were sort of too much for me, and they were quite boring. Although a cheatsheet was allowed in the exam, it seemed that those tested were never on the sheet...The professor spoke with a strong accent and he was always reading the slides directly instead of "teaching". But he's responsive to students' questions.The course gives too many data and statistics without really elaborating on their significance or importance. However, a lot of daily life mechanisms were explained thoroughly enough, such as how motors work.

There are also a lot of equations that have to be noted down. However, for some of the equations, the professors do not really explain well on how to use them, so it may be confusing to know when to use which equation during the exams.For some people who may not be acquainted with strong accents, it may be difficult to follow in class. Also, the professors have a tendency to speak softly at times. This makes it difficult at times to pay attention during the lecture as a lot of students who sit at the back of the lecture hall talk a lot.

One good thing, though, is that professor Tang and professor Wong both sometimes explain class materials in a more in-depth matter than what they put on the PowerPoint slides. Another good thing is the professors sometimes hold experiments during the lecture to demonstrate the materials that will be covered.Population growth, energy sources and consumption

Somehow boring since the professor just read the powerpoint in most of the time.similar to the content being taught in secondary school
not very interesting, but maybe suitable for the rational students
and cheatsheet is acceptable in the exams, that is niceteaching is fair
just read according to the content on the slidesLectures with the following topics and sequence:

Indeed, the last few topics are quite boring.The instructor's teaching is clear but it's quite boring as he speaks slowly. However, I don't think there is any difference between reading the materials on your own and attending the lecture in terms of materials understanding......as long as you have some phys background (energy, nuclear decay, electricity...).
Still, there is a reason that you should attend the lecture: the grading.A bit boring, the main content is basic facts, easy to understand, except the chapter on thermodynamics,
If you have studied DSE level physics with elective chapter on energy, it will be easier for you to remember some of the contentVery boring, some professors spoke monotone, can't even concentrate. Also, the majority of them only read according to the powerpoint, so, you actually can read it yourself.It is said that the content is not related to physics. And it is true. Seriously, you don't need any physics knowledge. Here is the topics:
01. Introduction to the course
02. Energy consumption & population growth
03. Fossil fuels
04. Temperature, heat and heat energy
05. Thermodynamics
06. Heat engine
07. Otto engine and passenger cars
08. Diesel engine and cargo ships
09. Jet engine and air travel
10. Midterm exam review
11. Electricity generation
12. Electricity power grid
13. Electric lighting
14. Energy storage and home heating cooling
15. Embodied energy in stuff
16. Nuclear energy I
17. Nuclear energy II
18. Water energy
19. Wind energy
20. Solar energy
21. Air pollution
22. Global warming and climate change
23. Final exam reviewYou may not understand the content because of their poor English. Sometimes they carry out some experiments, but you are just allowed to see it, but not to do it. Unless you sit in the front, you will not be able to see it clearly.Course content was mildly interesting at best, boring and irrelevant at worst, which unfortunately is the case most of the time.
They do make an effort to cover a wide range of topics that were somewhat related to energy. Hopefully that wide range was the only reason the course instructors struggle to answer student's question adequately during lectures.
The topics and questions examined in this course weren't exactly hard, but just randomly put together without much thought.
The HW and exam mostly consists of trivial arithmetic questions with technical terms stuck into it, challenging your understanding of the term "Physics exam". There was also cartoon, low res graphs where precise numbers had to be derived for accurate calculations. Did I also mention the occasional exam question that involves physics topics never mentioned once in all lectures and homework? Did they even look at the exam paper once before printing it?Couldn't understand what was coming out from the instructor's mouth most of the time. Fortunately they scraped the majority of the course contents from the internet so you can find the source yourself and study from there. If you don't understand anything from this course, just go to youtube. Have yet found a youtube video that explains the course topics worse than the lecturers. Though that begs the question: Why am I paying tuition fees?The content of this course are totally rubbish . You will learn nothing from this course . So many fucking historical statistic and data. Some content involve calculation and formula but without or lack of explanation.PowerPoint Just have some formula and so many unknown variable.The worst lectures I ever taken in HKUST.
Three professor just read through the powerpoint.
No extra content.Knowledge about environment, simply calculation
Related to physicDifferent lecturers responsible for different aspects of the lecture
Quite boring normally, but sometimes have experiments can be demonstrated.Good grade if you pay attention in class and pay little effort to review before the examination.
The examination is easy because you can bring your own cheat sheet.
you can pass the examination and get C grade easily if your cheat sheet is reliable enough, even though you do not listen to the lecture.this course has no homework, you only need to take attendance.
The workload is absolute zero unless you want to get A grade.Mostly about sustainable energy,
Aeroplanes, fossil fuels and renewable energyThe professors have very monotoned voice and will be very difficult to listen to especially early in the morning. Strongly recommend you not to take 9am lectures of this course.It includes basic knowledge concerning the environment as well as the use of energy. Many of them are DSE physics related, in the elective of energy. If you have studied for it before, it will be easy to understand the related part. The part concerning environment includes some common sense as well, which is quite easy.Teaching is quite boring as some of them are the same as the physics in DSE and some others can be easily understood by common sense. It is repetitive to listen to the content.For the mid-term exam part, most of them are about engines (diesel, ,jet, auto). As I am not a student with Physics background, this course is the most difficult course that I have taken till now. For the final exam part, most of them are about energy and calculations like how much energy is consumed and how much do we need to pay for electricity supply. At the beginning, I thought it would be better after the engine part. However, the energy part is not easy to understand. For me, I must write the formulas on the cheat sheet. If you are a Physics student, you must think that it is very easy.Teaching is the most boring part. I always feel tired in the lessons. And their English is not understandable. But you have to pay attention to the lesson because of the iprs session! You cannot skip lessons if you want to get 5% of your course marks. (5% is important to me because I am not a smart student)Basically everything about energy and environment. It will be a good grade common core if you take PHYS1112, or have taken physics course before. If you don't, you can still understand a bunch of stuff about environ, like global warming, pollution, recycling, etc.

To be honest, I don't know what I have learned after the courses. If you go for a Good-Graded Common Core, go for it. If you want to bring something useful or innovative, then you should not choose this courseYou barely need to be taught on those basic environ stuff,  but you may need an extra attention on thermal dynamics, aerodynamics(just a little)

Teaching is horribly boring, and they teach with their interesting accent. I would prefer an afternoon nap, rather than get up at 9, and sleep there.dull and tediousboringonly busy before the examsLIST OF TOPICS:
- Energy consumption and population growth
- Fossil fuels
- Thermodynamics
- Heat engines (Otto, diesel, jet)
~~~MIDTERM~~~
- Electricity generation and power grid
- Electric lighting
- Energy storage and home temperature regulation
- Embodied energy
- Nuclear, water, wind and solar energy
- Global warming and climate change
~~~FINAL EXAM~~~

There is an exam review lecture before each exam, which lays out the exact syllabus that may be examined.

Since this course requires HKDSE Physics level 3+, students are already familiar with many of the topics discussed. However, this course enables us to further extend our knowledge to many aspects of the real world, enhancing our understanding of energy generation and consumption.Dr. Wang and Dr. Wong's lectures are extremely boring, and they mostly read off the slides. Combined with the fact that they started at 9 am, I found it extremely difficult to stay awake without using my phone.

The PowerPoints are regularly uploaded to Canvas, you might as well skip the lectures and read the content online if you don't care about PRS marks.The whole course is NOT about physics, it's just about a bunch of facts and data. A large number of lecture notes is present but no physics knowledge was gained after the semester. Content was horrible.The professors don't really pay much effort in teaching this course, only reading out powerpoints. Not good.This course basically talk about the thermodynamics, renewable energy and energy related to daily things. The framework of this course is great, but the lecture slides are poorly designed with a lot of useless information and figures, which may make students feel distracted.
1 double-sided A4 cheat sheet is allowed in both mid-term and final exam.
Before Mid-term: Physics-related, mainly about thermodynaics, different types of engines: otto engine, diesel engine, jet engine.
After Mid-term: Topics covered are boarder and most of them are learnt in high school, including electricity, nuclear energy, electric lighting, nuclear energy; and some renewable energy, such as: water, wind, solar, etc. Finally, air pollution and global warming.Honestly, the course framework is great but the teaching is very bad, especially the lecturers' presentation.
Poor English presentation and the tone of these lecturers are really bad, making you feel boring and distracted.
The lecture notes are filled with figures and useless information with some important key points hidden (you need some time and effort to find it)
The demonstrations done by the TA are the most interesting part in the lecture.
After the course, you may find that you haven't learnt anything new and useful.the content is boring and messy and not useful at all(at least for a SBM student like me)
the course covers a lot of topics but goes deep into none of them
before midterm the focus is on thermodynamics and kinematics
after midterm the content gets even messier, we learned about electricity, pollution, and spent 1 to 2 lectures on every source of energy you can think of
the content in the PPTs are detailed and  advanced, which do not match the content of examsprofessors use this plain speaking style that makes me fall asleep in almost every single lecture
they always go too fast through the hard parts and seem to have no idea what highlighting is
the content is already boring, their teaching is of no help to the atmosphereThis course first talk about stupid factual stuff, then thermodynamics (only good part in this course I guess), then different types of engine, electricity, embodied energy, nuclear, wind, water, solar energy, finally air pollution and global warming.
The powerpoint is broken, fragmented, and there is about 3/4 of the powerpoint that is meaningless in my opinion, those are just random stupid statistics that have no help to our learning. What's even worse is that meaningful content (perhaps 3 slides per lecture) also show up like crap in the powerpoint, so it take quite a lot of effort to filter out useful content.The teaching is bad, really bad, especially the professors I encountered this semester are quite passionate so I am particularly disgruntled about the teaching. They are just reading the powerpoint, and as I mentioned before those powerpoint are crap, which make this even worse. They spoke without any passion and soul, and the lesson is at 9am, so I fell asleep every lesson (before I gave up attending it).The content is wide but not so deep. Read the PPT and you can know everything.Really bad. Every time I just want to go to sleep but it has IPRS.Mid-term Exam:                  45%

Final Exam:                        55%

Plus 5% bonus by PRS quizzes



Rules for PRS:

Full Marks for correct answers, half marks for incorrect answers, 0 marks for no answers.
Marks will not be counted during the add-drop period.

So you have to attend to the boring and useless lectures to get your IPRS mark. The midterm exam is not very difficult but some people thought it was not easy. The suggestion is preparing a good cheat sheet and review all the PPTs carefully.Almost no workload except for exam periods.The content is not really related to calculation of physics question but more about remembering different facts of physics. PPTs are provided on canvas. Many printed them out before classes to take notes.Both are pretty boring. They speak in flat tones.
Btw, the TAs are nice in answering questions :)Basic Physic Concept
Mainly memory thingQuiet Boring
But still need to go for PRSBelow mean nearly 2 SD C+

PRS 5%, Midterm 40%, Final 55%
Unreasonable grading with respect to the effort put in to learning the course content. Although a cheat sheet is allowed in the exams, it is of no use whatsoever. The paper has 2 parts- MC Questions with a ridiculous +5, -1 marking scheme and long answer questions with 10-20 marks awarded for correct answer (depending on question) and none for wrong. The curve comes absolutely ridiculous with 2-3 bell curves and high mean and S.D. that make it hard to assess one's performance.  People usually take Common Cores to bring their grades up, but really cannot expect that with this course.Not thing to doSome had been taught in secondary school and most of the content are not hard to understand. Even you don't come to lesson, you could also handle the examQuite detailed but a bit boringIt covers so many topics, from thermodynamics, global warming, renewable energy and so on... Basically it covers so much that there isn't any depth in any of the topics. The content is so shallow that you do not even need any science knowledge to comprehend. So I would say the content is easy, but not all that useful.I only went to the first 5 or so lectures, missed out every single lectures after mid-term. As far as I can tell, the instructor's English is pretty bad, and is terrible at handling computers and related technologies. The PRS does not work for most of the time, partly because the instructor is stupid, and also the TAs. Powerpoint reading for most of the time. Don't expect any quality teaching. No point in attending lectures unless you desperately need the PRS points.Before midterm is about how various types of engines work and how the work is done. Also talk about fossil fuel and plane. In this part, the most difficult part is how the engines work and the PV diagram.
After midterm is about various of energy, like solar power, wind power, hydropower, nuclear power and so on.
in total 22 lecture slides and all packed with information and knowledge, you need to absorb.Even when I attend the class I do not pay much attention since he basically just reading the slides.
But he is very responsible, every time you ask a question, he will answer you patiently and send an announcement to clarify.
When final, he found out there are problems in marking, he remarked all the paper again (for the two questions which marked incorrectly by TAs)about energy, about energy from different form, like light, heat , kinetic etc.rubbish, watching youtube's video is more interestingquite good,
MT above mean a bit,
Final below 1sd,
B-
i didnt go to lesson for half sem, iprs only count 5% so it didnt affect much of my gradeIPRS only,
make cheat sheet
you can make many cheat sheet as you can as they will not really check during the final exam,
basically do some work for the calculation question will be good for doing the finalenergy the content is very very boring and crappy. Given the course name and topic, it could have been made much more interesting. They say "This course is about numbers" but well, the theory and numerical part don't seem to make sense together and the large class size and 3 professors teaching just ruins it. If you're looking to take this course for S&T SSC, you're probably better off taking ENGG 1150.boringContent is common and easy. I wouldn't say it is bad but it contains quite a lot of common sense and data analysis. If u are interested in energy or world emission and pollution. U can give it a tryThe teaching is very bad. The instructors don't care about the atmosphere of the class at all. Most of the lectures are just noisy with the unclear presentation of the instructor which you cant learn at all.In this course, it has mid term and exam(one A4 cheat sheet can be taken with you to the exam)
also need to take prs(if the ans correct you will get 1 marks ,if not you will get 0.5 marks)
the question and answer will be covered in the lessons ,but it may ask about the question in previous lectureI dont know
I haven't attend any lessons
prs is taken by my friendsNothing special, it is all about energy, engines and some easy equations. If you have studied basic physics in high school then there would be nothing new to learn. Because it is just common knowledge that physics students would know. The hardest thing might be engine because the course will go through the four stages of a combustion engine.Poor, but you can study by yourself. Basically, the teacher has strong Chinese accent, you can't really understand every single word in the sentence, but with the use of common sense and powerpoint, you should be fine. This is a course where you could skip all the classes.Copy from Canvas

-Environment issues in Hong Kong, PRD and the rest of the worldQuite boring to students. The instructors just followed the powerpoint without stressing on the main point in each chapter. Most materials are data, not relative to the course.The content is boring and relative with energy and social environmental problems instead of pure physics. We can learn more on the various types of energy in the world but only the basic knowledge of them.Two professors were reading the power points and seldom explained or taught something. The rhythm and pace of the lectures are distracting.very boring. about every kinds of energy, trivial and useless. If you have ever studied physics in senior high school, those contents are of no difficulties. However, too many details in it and you have no way to remember them all. And your grade is largely depending on could you write a good cheat sheet that correspondes to the questions and try to avoid calculation mistales.Very bad. Just reading ppt. Teachers' English is unacceptable. The most boring lectures Ive ever attended. Not taught well at all. Most of the lectures are just reading out the slides without any meaning as such.Basic knowledge which you can guess the answers in MC and calculation through the unit, for example, total amount required to pay electrical payment = $100 dollar/person x 5 persons = $500, which is the simple calculation in examination. After you studied PHYS1112, or even PHYS1114, you may think that it is common sense.Nice Hong Kong and mainland professors alternately teach each lecture. Speaking tone is boring but still can be followed up.
Experiment may demonstrate in last minutes of lecture, not important, but interesting for your understanding what theory does.easy content.
many lectures were similar to the HKDSE syllabus.boring teaching
professors read out the powerpoint in the lesson.
There were some experiments demonstrations at the end of the lessonsIf you have studied Physics in high school, that would be great, as most of the content cover DSE E3 (Energy and use of energy). Few of them is new but can easily understand.

I think as a common core, is very easy to handle for students take physics as electives in DSE or would prefer physics as major in university.(Thumbs down only for their teaching style)

Unfortunately, teaching style is not really satisfy to all students as unclear ascent make you hard to understand the lecture.

To be fair, I would like to said that both profs. are very passionate, if you have any questions, prof. would answer you thoroughly, but their teaching style are just a bit unsatisfactory.Some DSE phy with basic concepts of energy(electricity, solar, fossil,nuclea, etc.) Absolutely boring topics covered. Too much of stats and data stuffed into the lecture slides that confuse and perplex when preparing for the exams.Super boring, i skipped class quite often thou the course has PRS.
The instructor are from mainland so you should expect for  difficulties in listening to them.The content is not useful, but mainly about energy elective in DSE Physics. Mid term exam is a bit different from DSE, final is quite similar. Mid term and final exams dominate 95% of overall result.The instructors just followed the powerpoint. Most materials are data, not relative to the course. Quite boring to students.- Growth of energy consumption and population, fossil fuel powered machines
-Fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas
-Basic energy principles and thermodynamics, including 1st and 2nd law, heat engine efficiency
-Petrol and diesel engines for land and sea transport, gas turbine for air transport
-Electricity generation, motors, and electricity in Hong Kong

-Environment issues in Hong Kong, PRD and the rest of the world

This course is just so bad. The course is basically "inspired" by a book written by an expert in energy and then taught as a common core course. To be frank, the course is neither interesting nor useful.

The course covers stuff about the above topics listed in some detail, but not detail enough to make the things we learn applicable in a useful way. For example, they just mention the famous E = mc equation but do not teach anything on how to use and apply it. They even like to present a lot of data in the slides. How do we even study them? Take a look at the attachment and see for yourself.

To your surprise, the things you learn during lectures aren't really the things that appear in the exams. For example, you learn about particulates in the air and their effects during lectures but they ask you to calculate the density of the particulates in the exam. This is as ridiculous as teaching stuff from one book and then asking questions from another.

This course is also very unprofessional. There are way too many assumptions and they make the calculations meaningless. Also, the words the course use are not precise. Once, there was a question that asked: "Which energy source is the most important?". Important in terms of what? How do you define important? This just makes students confused and then pisses them off.Just look at other reviews. I'm not going to waste too much time on this.

The lecturers' monotone made their presentations plain. Sometimes, they couldn't even complete a sentence and they just moved on.

The funny thing is that they wrote stuff on the whiteboard, using a thin marker which barely had any ink in front of a Lecture Theatre with 400 seats. Of course, you could see what they were writing.

I'm sorry for being that harsh and sarcastic but I have wasted my youth on this course.The content covers some basic physics topics like heat, energy and environmental issue but it contains many numbers and graphs. The midterm and final are non-cumulative.Very boring teaching. I suggest you to study by yourselfThis course is about energy and sustainability. There are lots of chapters and slides. However, most of the contents are very boring since it covers lots of areas.Very boring and not helpful. However, due to prs grade, most students would be willing to attend the lectures. Lectures are really, really boring and I got to sleep very lecture I attended.Before Midterm: Fossil Fuel, Temperature, Engines
After Midterm: Electricity, Energy Production, Global Warming (Non-cumulative)

Every lecture will teach over 20 or even 30 pages. And sometimes they put the material as "self study" and wont teach it during lectures.

Overall the course material is not very concise and sometimes clumsy to study.Extremely boring. Both lecturers have weird accents and often cannot convey their message properly.

The pace is not consistent; the tone is boring. As far as I can tell, often 2/3 of the class will sleep during the lectures (9:00-10:20).

Also the lecturers fail to stress on the main point, and this leads to difficulties in studying this course.I think the content is quite useless and boring. The course has nothing to do with physics. And the course overall is about common sense.Both the two teachers are boring. The course is not logically clear. And WONG always runs out of time and extend the class for more 5 to 10 minutes.Bad grade.
The midterm and final allow you to bring a cheatsheet. But the content is too much, and sometimes you need to put statistics on.Light work load.
There will be some homework, but students are not supposed to hand in. It is said that similar questions will appear in midterm and final.Mostly secondary school stuff. Pretty easy. Just a little bit complicated and annoying for the conversion of the units.The professors got a pretty strong accent which you are probably not willing and cannot understand what they are trying to teach you. Moreover, one of the professors tends to read out what's on the powerpoint which is equally frustrating.I personally had interest, so the content of the course was quite interesting. It gives quantitative explanations of energy-related issues around us, and I was able to gain more knowledge about energy.

People might find it boring. Depends on personal preference.Teaching could improve.
Not the best teaching, but still the course itself is well organized, the professors are clear and precise about what they are talking about.The content itself is meaningful: a clear review of all types of energy and their effect on environment and human society. Yet it is not deep enough and too general, which is typical for ccc.Three professors teaching together makes it a little bit messy and disorganised. And the accent of certain professor needs improving badly, which may effect the quality of teaching.
The experiments at the beginning of lecture are not clearly demonstrated  and explained and it king of time-wasting.Although one A4 cheatsheet is allowed in the mid term and final, I personally think that the course syllabus is too broad even for those with physics background. However, this course is mainly about numbers and computations, so it should be fine for those who are sensitive to numbers.

PRS questions contribute up to 5% of the total mark.The lecture is generally boring and I think some lecturers may even read directly from the slides. I always ended up playing my phone or taking a nap till the end of the lecture.Rather general, easy for those taking physics in high school
But then if you can chose phys1001, choose that not this one, this course is boring as hellthe best napping place ever, no one's listening, and the lecturing does not expect you to listen as wellWho said the grading is good??
Ever since some students complained that the grade is "too good", they made the grading really harshnot much, but then there's a PRS quiz from time to time, and if you have friends doing that for you then it's fineThe whole course is about a batch of meaningless numbers, data and formula. There is no explanation with respect to any part of the notes and 90% of the "articles" in the powerpoint are just the waste of ink from the printers.Too many things to be examined for a common core. You won't have enough time to work on every topics so that you could only look at your cheatsheet during the exam.Boring. There'd be experience from time to time tho
You need to attend every lectures in order to get the PRS mark.
In fact, you could use iPRS everywhere as long as you have the code.It covers a lot of information that you will need to "remember" ( write on your A4- size cheat sheet ). It takes a very long time just to browse through all the lecture power point. Don't take the course if you don't like tones of power point lecture notes.Honestly, they taught quite boring.

But you will have to take it for the sake of PRS.Actually I always do other stuffs during lecture so I really dont know what the lecturer is talking about.There were a lot of experiment during the lecture that I  am quite appreciate.
Dont expect you will get something in the lecture.The grade is good! Most Long questions are in HW. Just copy all HW into your cheatsheet.

Midterm and Final above 1SD --> ANo workload. Maybe prepare the cheatsheet and PRS.
Every lesson will have one or two PRS questions. Students should go 30 minutes after begining the lessonOne of the worst courses I have ever taken and I've also taken Mech1905 with Moses. Their teaching team is pathetic. The midterm questions did not cover more than 50% of what was taught in the lectures (they only ask questions which are easier than lecture notes but you will never know because their lecture notes are long and incoherent.) They take attendance every flipping lecture, 2 per week and its 9am every lecture. Who the fuck even does that, I'm like 20 years old. Half the information taught wont be tested and its just useless to your education.The shittiest teaching team you will ever experience. If you currently have an interest in physics and want to learn more, do not take this course unless you have decided that you dont want to be associated with physics anymore. The professors are completely useless and they cover the most useless materials which will not be tested in the midterm. The only good thing about this course is that everything they talk about can be found in lecture notes but they bullshit so much in the lecture notes so there isnt really a point.The course starts with fossil fuels, then goes into car engines (which involve a lot of first and second law of thermodynamics). Electricity and renewable energy comes after the midterm.

Powerpoints are poorly compiled (equations show up as computer notation, e.g. fractions use"/", very difficult to interpret), the language used is full of grammatical mistakes that make the content very difficult to comprehend.Boring lecturers, poor spoken english, basically reading off powerpoints. Having 3 professors teaching is a mistake in the first place.To get good grade, just work hard to remember many numbers cuz you cannot print every thing on cheat sheetIt's one of the most boring lectures I have ever taken but the PRS test forces us to take the lecture lolgood. It seems that there is about 40% A http://range.So it won't be difficult to get A range, but it is hard to get  an  A+Wow you can play computer on the lecture but you need to remember a lot of things before the exam.It's just common sense course. Content is very easy, you have to remember a lot, but the calculations and formula are relatively easy. But you can have a double-sided A4 cheat sheet for both midterm and final (non-accumulative). Just put everything on the cheat sheet, but I did reorganize the material.Content is easy and boring, everything is on the lecture notes. So most of the time, professors are just reading the notes. But they are trying to make the course interesting and you can see that. For example, class demonstrations, videos and so on.This course is talking about the energy, for example, the light energy, etc. If fact you don't need to know the things precisely to get a good grade.Quite boring, just read ppt out. It is not necessary to listen to the lesson since copy whole ppt into cheatsheet is enough.The grading is good. Mean is B. Above mean a bit can get A range. (It is very easy to get above mean if you look through the ppt once, or even just look through few topics, bcs the exam's long q is super easy, very basic calculation, easier than high school level.) I haven't revise for the final exam and get below mean, still get a B.Just copy all the things into cheatsheet can guarantee you to get at least A range. The most annoying things is the PRS so that you need to attend the lesson every time to do your own things.The content is similar to the energy electives for HKDSE, and it was not very difficult to study it on your own. You'll be delighted with the content if you love physics.The lesson is extremely boring, with poor English accent from the professors, you could barely understand what they are talking about, so brace yourself to study the course materials on your own for exams.L1:      Introduction to the course and Population Growth

I know many students say PHY1003 is good grade, but i would say it only suitable to students with science background (I am not saying DSE phy, as many materials are new and I don't think I would be fine if I have DSE physic background)Course Outline

But the lecturer is kindly answer your question.Topics before midterm are generally easy. You should be able to excel in the midterm if you have a good foundation in DSE Maths and Physics, even you may not have studied  the astronomy elective in DSE Physics before. However, the real journey to astronomy starts after midterm. The main focus is the universe structure, eg how stars form and how stars die, and dark energy about an acceleratingly expanding universe. Since the course is only an introduction, as its name suggests, the topics are not too hard if you are willing to work hard.Despite of the difficulty of topics, and his English proficiency, Mr Sou is really enthusiastic about physics and he works really hard to make his presentation as clear as possible to students. Mr Sou is really respectable.Prof. Tam like to mess up students' mind by introducing abstract ideas like the meaning of terms in Einstein's field equation. After all, those complex ideas will not be tested in exams. Though the content is somehow difficult to understand, it will be interesting from the perspective of a astronomy lover.Overall, Prof. Tam is a responsible lecturer. However, I will not say he is a perfect lecturer since his tone and way of speaking  was not able to catch my attention all the time.PART I: Developing Perspective

Just some basic concepts for astronomy, but it may take some time to consume all of them.The teaching style is normal, and the teaching speed is  acceptable.
The instructor is good.Syllabus: origin of modern astronomy, gravity, light and telescope, star light and atoms, stars (binary, formation, evolution, death), neutron stars and black holes, normal galaxies, peculiar galaxies, cosmology, the solar system, life on other world
Material: lecture notes and assignment for self practice (not graded)
Attendance: iPRS question at the end of each lectureGood teaching, very clear explanationBefore the mid-term, it is quite easy. Most of the concept can be understand by knowledge of secondary physics even though you didn't choose astronomy as elective subject. After the mid-term the content will talk about the birth of universe, galaxy ,stars, black hole, dark matter etc. The concept will be a little bit hard but still acceptable.Most of them are power point reading. But the video and simulation in the power point is helpful for you to understand the concept. But still that doesn't means that you can skip lecture because it has iprs every lecture.Further study of the elective of HKDSE Physics.
Need to have interest because there is many new things you need to study.
Watch out and try to do the best in exams as the 2 exams will decide what your grade is.Prof. Sou is a very good professor and I highly recommend having this course if he is the lecturer.
He always sends email to us talking about what the notes (the ppt) are mistaking or something that might be wrong.you can learn a lot about the formation of galaxies and stars, dark energy and dark matter. whoever is curious about the secrets of  the universe will love it! sometimes the prof showed us some animations to help us understand the points. IPRS is in the end of every class. the questions are all form the slides. sometimes they are about concepts, sometimes are calculations.the professor has a strong accent. but don't worry, you can find all the points mentioned in the class in the textbooks.I believe the content is manageable, taking it from someone who took the HKDSEs and not taking Astronomy as an elective (and also a year 1 student).
Note that the content before the Midterm (Ch.1-6) is not included in the Finals.
Anything before Midterms is very easy to understand, but be prepared to do quite a bit of self-study after that.

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Fate of the UniverseHis style of teaching tends to make me doze off, even when I'm actually interested in the topic. But I do try to pay attention otherwise I have to go through all the thinking process when I do self-study with the powerpoint, which can take quite a while especially with topics after midterms.
But you can see that he's quite passionate about Astronomy (especially as he may overrun once in a while) and he's always happy to answer any questions.Interesting content if you are interested in learning about the basic fundamental knowledge of the universe. During the beginning of the semester it's pretty easy but toward the end of the semester the content gets lengthy and there's a lot to study for the finals.The professor seems really interested in what he teaches, but he doesn't have the most exciting voice that draws students in, so if you don't actively pay attention you will find your attention drifting during class.Introduction to our Universe; observation in astronomy; origin of modern astronomy.  Newton's law of motions; gravity; light, atoms and telescope. The Sun; stellar formation and evolution; white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. The Milky way Galaxy; Normal galaxies, active galaxies and supermassive black holes. Foundation of modern cosmology; dark matter, dark energy and the fate of the Universe; the beginning of time.

The concept was quite difficult to understand though DSE Physics has been takenThe content of this class is derived from a textbook which is available for purchase at the bookstore. However, it is not necessary to purchase this book as all the information you need is provided by the instructor on the lecture slides.

The course will introduce the student to the nature of the cosmos through a thorough and satisfying scope, which includes basic astronomy (moon phases, solstices, equinoxes, celestial sphere), basic physics (Kepler, Newton, tides, EM waves, etc.) and then combines the two to progress towards the analyses of stars, galaxies, and the universe.

It is important to note that attendance is "required" in the sense that at the end of each lecture, there will be a PRS question, which WILL count towards your final grade, albeit only 5%.Professor Sou is an engaging and interesting lecturer and class rarely gets boring. There is engagement with the students and the content is well presented. He is also open to any questions asked during or after the lecture, which has helped the atmosphere of the class and understanding of the students.The course introduces the basic knowledge of Astrophysics,including the structure of the universe, life cycle of the star, dark energy and so on. Most of the course content is clear and easy to understand.The pace of teaching is quite fast. The professor only reads the powerpoint directly.I took Astronomy as my elective in HKDSE.

Of course, some of the contents overlap with this course.
The beginning is easy to follow but the part since Star Birth starts to get difficult. (Chapter 16 onwards)

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Fate of the UniversProfessor Tam's English is understandable. He wants us to get interested in this subject by watching movies. He speaks in a relatively flat and slow tone.
He would regularly ask students whether we catch up his points, and quite willing to answer students' inquiries.The early parts of the courses are already covered in high school physics elective part. The overall content is not difficult, but vasic physics knowledge is needed.The teaching is quite boring. However, the movie viewing session is very interesting, especially for those who are very interested in or have more knowledge in astronomy.First few lecture are about seasons, the Moon, and observing stars. Then it's about stars, galaxies and the universe. Nothing about planet though. There's also some physics in between, like Newtons' law and nuclear fusion, but you only need to remember them.It's a bit nicer than PowerPoint-reading, but not a lotThe course is composed of three part:
1.Final (50%)
2.Movie(35%) (Yes, you need to watch movie besides the lecture time)
3.IPRS(15%)
The content is generally interesting. If you are interested in physics, you will find it not difficult to comprehend the concept. But it's actually fine that you don't understand the content because you just need to memorise everything in the final to get a high mark.The teaching is sometimes interesting but my instructor said that was his last year of teaching.
You need to do IPRS two to three times which spread evenly during the class. Most of the questions are tricky and you need to pay attention not to fall into traps.A Modern View of the Universe

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Fate of the UniverseProfessor Tam would explain the ppt in detail on a need to know basis and would have PRS to constantly challenge our understanding in class. He inspired me to know more about astronomy.It is quite difficult as a common core course, especially for the students without or lack of science background. Even you have studied Physics in HKDSE does not mean you know what happened. People without the real interest in Astronomy and Aerospace should never reg this course.Professor is passionate to teach with different ways of examples and elaborations, but he is just too boring and you will find it difficult to summarize his teaching. You will find many students fall asleep in his lessons because you will lose the focus with his voice. The ppt covers a lot but you are not easy to sort out the useful materials for your exams.Cover a lot about the universe without touch much into difficult part such as relativity. Some of the content require quantum mechanics' explanation but are not included in exam and so don't worry. The starting part with celestial etc. took me sometime to understand but overall it's not really hard.
I have studied Phys 1112 but most of the content are irrelevant to 1112 and so no need to worry about someone massacring.The prof and TA are willing to answer questions and give comprehensible explanation to some difficult parts.The content is quite straightforward and easy. Although some of the content is difficult to understand as I didn't study the astronomy parts in secondary school. Yet once you understand, it is not difficult.The prof. is not boring and enthusiastic to teach, he understands some parts that I confused with, so he emphasizes a bit more on those points before going through.pretty easy before midterm, some basic concept about earth, sun, moon,etc
get a lot deeper into space with a lot of terms and complicated after midtermtrying hard to grab attention and sometimes make jokes. Mostly focus on notes. Some people fall asleep during class.Part of the content is similar to what I learnt in senior high school, so it is very easy to catch up. But after the midterm it will be much more difficult when it comes to stars and galaxies.
The content will cover the Earth, stars and galaxies. It tells about the birth and death of them.A little bit boring, but you will learn something practical.
Sometimes there are videos to help me understand.Before mid-term, some general concepts about the universe, the 'sky' we observe and some basic astrophysics are covered. Having studied DSE Physics E1(Astronomy elective) will give you a little advantage before midterm, but it's easy for others to catch up.
Summary of topics included:
Key terms in astronomy, Look-Back Time, Use of scales in astronomy, Earth's orbit and rotation, Constellation, Celestial sphere, Seasons, Tropicals, Moon phases, Eclipses, Retrograde motion, Astronomy and ancient cultures, History and development of astronomical models, Ptolemaic/Heliocentric/Kepler model, Kepler's laws, Galilean Principle of Relativity, Newton's laws, Angular momentum, Thermal energy, Tides and Tidal forces, EM waves, Spectrums, Stefan-Boltzmann’s law, Wien’s law, Doppler effect, Telescopes

After mid-term, important concepts of modern cosmology are introduced.
Summary of topics included:
Sun(Structure, hydrostatic equilibrium, nuclear reactions, solar activities), Brightness(Luminosity and apparent brightness, relation with distance, distance modulus, relation with temperature, Spectral types), Binary star systems, HR Diagram(Luminosity class, main sequence stars, dwarfs, giants), Star clusters(Classification, evolution), Stellar Birth(Nebulae, process of creation of stars, limit of star masses), Stellar Death(Aging of stars, helium flash, planetary nebula, supernova explosion), White dwarfs(Formation, accretion disks, nova), Supernova(Type I and II), Neutron star(Formation, pulsars), Black Hole(Nature, Structure, Schwarzschild radius, Tidal forces, Gravitational effects), Galaxy(Types, Structures, Galactic recycling, history, collisions, galactic center), Spectroscopic parallax, Variable stars, Hubble’s Law, Cosmological Principle, Active galaxies(Quasars, Radio galaxies, structures, power sources), Dark matter(Possible composition, existence), Big Bang Model, Critical Density, Dark Energy, Fate of UniverseProf. Sou clearly shows his passion on teaching. His English is clear and can explain/introduce new physics/cosmology concepts to us in an organized way. It can be observed that he prepared a lot for the course as well, as he can discuss new or hotly debating issues/concepts in astronomy without much hesitation. The only thing to criticize(which doesn't affect my A ranking on teaching) is that his lecture notes are not tidy enough.Mostly taught is basic astronomy, but with some dark matter and energy,which are not included in exam.

Very easy to astronomy enthusiast and those who are with strong physics background. But still need some effort if you have no idea with astronomy.Nearly read the PPT directly. But sometimes the things are not on the notes, so you still need to listen carefully.Introduction to our Universe; observation in astronomy; origin of modern astronomy.  Newton's law of motions; gravity; light, atoms and telescope. The Sun; stellar formation and evolution; white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. The Milky way Galaxy; Normal galaxies, active galaxies and supermassive black holes. Foundation of modern cosmology; dark matter, dark energy and the fate of the Universe; the beginning of time.If you are not interested in astronomy, it will be quite boring. Although the instructor tried to use a different way to express the concepts, it made it worse. There was a lot of videos, news and photos, some of them was very interesting. They will provide tutorial sessions before the exam, you may ask them questions or seek for help.Chapters before midterm are easier, mostly included in the HKDSE physics astronomy module. More complex content swarms in after midterm.

Constellation, seasons, phases of moon, eclipses, different astronomy models and philosophies, tides, light (luminosity, doppler's effect etc.),  telescopes, structure, birth, and death of stars, planets, galaxies and black holes, stellar parallax, detection methods, big bang model, inflation theory, dark matter, dark energy etc.

The content sounded really fascinating to me. It is a great choice if you wish to learn more about astronomy.The teaching is generally alright. I can feel that Dr. Tam does care about his teaching. He and his TAs are very willing to answer students' questions after class. But at times it can be tiring to listen to Dr. Tam's accent and presentation, especially when you had a long day of class. Another drawback is that his powerpoints are often not concise enough. For me, I removed slides that are not necessary and regrouped the content into fewer slides for later use.Introductory course for astronomy so you are expected to learn all the stuff in the universe ranging from planets to galaxy clusters to special relativity and blackholes lol If you are interested in stuff like that you will find it very easy to understand. There are lots of extra and undated knowledge shared by professor such as gravity wave which is very interesting in my opinion. Some calculations are required but really simple....Easy to follow and up-to-date...although sometimes it's a bit boring (maybe because of prof's voice? idk) And prof are willing to ans your questions which is really nice..there are also TAs who are extremely helpful...The content of this course is basically all the cahpters in the book named "Cosmic Perspective" and it is quite long. Starting with "looking at the sky" up to "dark energy and inflation theory" the content will be harder as you move on during the semester.Professor is really nice and is doing his best to explain difficult concepts to non-physics students. He is willing to answer questions after the lectures. To me, his english is better than "just good", but it is the pace and the tone of his speaking that actually makes me fall asleep. So, professor is really good at teaching.The content was more or less simple as it was detailedly explain in the lecture notes.

(You can bring cheat sheet to exams)

Textbook is recommended if you have difficulties in understanding the concepts.
(can be borrowed in library, not a reserve book)Very boring tone, read directly from Powerpoint slideThis course introduces students to origin of modern astronomy, gravity, light and telescope, star light and atoms, stars (binary, formation, evolution, death), neutron stars and black holes, normal galaxies, peculiar galaxies, cosmology, the solar system, life on other world. The content before midterm is relatively easier which focus more on the moon, the four seasons on earth and the position of stars at the night skyMr Sou is a responsible professor. He is willing to answer any questions from students. He encourages us to think and ask more as he likes to interact and exchange ideas with students.Basic concepts about astronomy, including stars, galaxies, dark matter, dark energy, etc..Prof. Tam has a really poor tone in comparison with other local professor, but still understandable.

He is willing to stay after the lectures and answer students' questions in Cantonese.Basic content related to astronomy. Not too difficult, even for someone who's not done astronomy before. There is a textbook, but it's not really needed, the professor's slideshows are sufficient.Prof. Sou has a voice well suited for lullabies, and generally 20 minutes into the lecture about 75% of the class is sleeping.It is quite easy and fun if you love Astronomy.
The course before midterm mainly give you a simple knowledge for astrophysics and there are quite few equations.
However, after midterm, the content will be more difficult and more equations will be included. But it is still manageable since the exam has only short questions and MC and you really dont need to know the details.Prof Chan is quite funny professor. He used funny expressions and demonstration. There are also some video for you to watch in the lessons.Absolute grading

The course content is quite easy and not too much, even without any background in astronomy or advanced math/physics. It's quite fun if you are interested in this subject, especially the 2nd half of the course which focuses on stars, galaxies, cosmology.The professor is quite clear and explains concepts well, also tried to make the content more fun and relevant to us. But sometimes the lectures can be boring and a lot of people don't attend, especially since he only reads from the PPTs which are uploaded online.indepth version of dse content
quite difficult for me, need time to do more exercise to get understandChen>Choy>Law
Although my instructor is prof law who is passionate in teaching, he is quite boring and i am not able to understand well the concept, however he is a prof to spend much time and willing to answer questions
Prof choy's tutorial count on attendance. he have been substitute my lecture and i think he performed well
prof chen is the lecturer i think is the best, who is humorous and have a lot of exercises and extra tutorial lessons before tests to prepare you wellThe content is okay. Mostly mechanics and little thermodynamics. What I learned in this course was pretty much same as what I learned in AP Physics 1 class in high school, so I didn't feel much difficult. Just a little bit of calculus skills are needed? (actually just simple calculation is needed more than calculus, so you don't need to be afraid even if you are not good at calculus)I'm sorry to the professor but his lectures were not helpful at all. The lectures didn't help me at all to solve homework questions and test questions.Motions and Newton's laws
Work and energy
Conservation of energy and momentum
Rotation
Rigid body
Simple harmonic and damped oscillations
Forced oscillations
Standing waves and sound waves
Kinetic theory
The laws of thermodynamicsTeaching is quite clear. It is essential to attend the tutorial sessions because TA's teaching is better than the instructor. Although you may be confused by the difficult concepts of the lesson, TA will teach you the skill of answering questions and practice for the exam.This course covers 3main topics, some of them have been taught in the DSE Physics Level, not the combined one.

1. Force and Motion
In this topic, it introduces: Newtons Law, Circular motion, Linear and Augulat Momentum, Grativation.....

2. Wave and Sound
In this topic, it introduces: Characteristic of different types of waves, Simple Harmonic Motion...

3. Heat
In this topic, it introduces: Laws of ThermodynamicsFrankly speaking, the instructor is extremely bad.

His pronunciation of English was fair and was acceptable but I dont think he is good. Always skip slides and with no further explanations into a particular slide or topic. He only followed the ppt and sometimes It seems that he comes without any preparations.

In conclusion: His lesson = Waste of your time

Recommendations for spring Phys1112: Chan Ho Bun
Fall: Cheung Man FungA LOT OF  CONTENT

/

For Mathematics, it used a lot single variable calculus but sometimes included partial differentiation and some differentiation equation, it might be challenging to those new to it. Also, included vector.

/

For Physics, it included Newton's law, Energy, Momentum, Dynamics of rigid body, Angular momentum, Gravitation, Periodic motion, Wave, Heat, Law of thermodynamics

/

Warning(tips): NEVER TRY TO THINK YOU CAN LEARN ALL OF THESE EVEN YOU GOT GREAT RESULT IN DSE

For those interested in Physics, it might widen your horizon; if you are not, you might be deadly flooded with tons of knowledge.GOOD

/

I attended total about 4-5 lecture only since the class is too early...
btw, the lecturer will explain and prove the theorem in the slides clearly
It might be helpful if you want to build a solid foundation.

For me, I basically learn all the thing from reading the textbook and slides, it is enough.This course contains about 80% new things for students with DSE physics background. The contents are interesting if you are interested in physics. But, The syllabus includes a lot of unfamiliar constant and symbol. I believe more than  90% of students cannot fully understand the topics. But still, even you cannot fully understand the contents, you can still get quite a high grade in the final. The lectures emphasis on the prove of equations, but in the tests and final, they are more about examples. the final have somehow more conceptual questions compared to the tests. But only a quarter of them are these kind of difficult questions. So you may spend more time in the practical questions in mastering physics before test and final.Cheung Man Fung is a passionate teacher. He put much time in proving the physical formula. It is depended on you whether it is good or not. In my opinion, I think it is better to put more effort in introducing the examples instead of proving the equations since most of us cannot understand how the  equations come. Doing more practices may be better for helping us to clarify the concept.First few chapters are DSE mechanics
Advanced stuff later on like rotational mechanics, SHM
Wave and Sound
Thermodynamics

Little calculus involved in calculations, mostly used in proving   formulas, physical intrepretation eg area under PV graph-Teaching is OK
-Often demonstrates the proofs for the formulas(a lot of calculus involved)
-Some experiment demonstrations
-He talks about advanced stuff when there is extra time left
-He organised an extra tutorial before final which I really appreciatedProf Cheung is a good teacher and professor, he will listen to our question and answer us patiently. During his lesson, he will give out a lot of demonstration. Although some time he skip the lesson ( I remember one time he went to America and didnt flight back on time.), he still give us an extra lesson.Even though everyone taking this class should have taken physics and M2 is secondary school, but this class is still too fast and difficult for most of us.
The content is always started with something that seems we learnt in secondary school, but in a more advanced manner(i.e. involving a lot of calculus, especially integration). The content will usually become very difficult in the second part of the topic, consisting more concepts, new methods and difficulties.
Also the topics in a semester is not really related, from gravitation to force and motion and to gas. The content may confused people when taking a quiz because of don't know what equations should be usedProfessor Cheung is good at explaining difficult concepts and very clear about it. But sometimes he may goes a bit too fast for students hard to keep track on.The course content is very similar to IB Physics + IB Physics engineering option. Rotational mechanics is extremely hard and takes a long time to fully understand. Concepts are hard however the level of calculus needed isn't that hard.Tian Wen Chen was an okay teacher, his demonstrations were sometimes funny however most of the lecture consisted of him teaching from the lecture slides and showing proofs of equations. My suggestion would be that going to lecture is only useful for tough topics and if you have any questions.Before midterm are just simple secondary school physics knowledge, but after it, you will learn some AL physics knowledgeBoring, you can skip the lesson if you want since the teaching style of this instructor is following the notes and read all the things on them again during the lessons.The grade is not bad and fair enough, I have done all my online assignment with 100% marks and finished the midterm with 90% and the final exam with 70%, finally I got A in this course.There is an online assignment each week, it's easy to finish if you get any sources from the senior. But i recommend you to revise all knowledge taught in the lessons immediately since you need to pay double time to understand it if you don't do soNot very difficult at the beginning. We can learn some of the knowledge in our secondary school. The difficulty will increase after midterm. We have to understand what we have learnt.Professor is patient and helpful. Teaching is a bit boring but we can understand the knowledge deeply in the course.It covers quite a lot from what we've done in high school with some additional content in each of the parts. The concepts are understandable but require a lot of practice to really grasp it completely as some of the questions in the tests and exam can be tricky.I found the lectures to be a waste of time. The professor was struggling to make us understand some of the concepts. I'd suggest to study for the course by yourself.If you studied physic in secondary school, the content was easy to you because about 50% of the content was taught in secondary school. If you studies M2 in secondary school, it would be better.

This course had two quizzes instead of a mid-term examination this year (2015 Fall), I don't know whether it will change next year because the course had a mid-term exam but no quizzes.The tutorial class will teach you how to think to solve the problem step by step. And the lecture notes are similar to secondary school textbook.Level of content isn't too high. Covers everything done in high school. Exams might have a couple of trick questions oherwise it's doable.This course covers the mechanics part of physics -
kinematics
work, energy and power
rotational motion
Simple harmonic motion
Sound
ThermodynamicsLecture is a waste of time. First of all it's super boring plus the level of English wasn't up to the mark. The professor was unable to make us understand the concepts in English. It's better to buy the book and do it yourself. It'll prove to be more helpful.No CommentBefore the first quiz, (beginning of the course), mainly is DSE Physics, plus something that will be explained in calculus.

Before the second quiz, it is about the circular motion, wave, gr
In the
There will be two quiz in the whole semester.The teaching is quite good.This course mainly focuses on force and wave
It is much more difficult than secondary school
Also, you need to have maths background(differentiation and integration)The lecturer clearly explains the details of the phenomenon and the knowledge of physics. But sometimes, you will feel boring

The tutorial has attendance. Therefore, you need to attend the tutorial. You form a group during the tutorial. This class is for revision of the lectureIt's OK for the depth and width of the syllabus
For DSE syllabus student, the first half of the syllabus is just the high school things
But later on, the difficulty will significantly increase after the mid-term examgood teaching for Pro. Leung
He had a lot of funny explanation with a bunch of metaphors to explain some theories and observationNot as easy as imagined. Especially after midterm, those contents are not covered in high school and requires calculus.Lecture notes are very comprehensive and there's lecture video uploaded. CHEN Tian wen is one of the best professors I've ever met. I asked about words during exams, which I found very basic at the end. But he translated for me so patiently.DSE PHYSICS + Rigid body with CALCULUS EXPRESSION

However if you participate more in tutorials, you can gain from it since it is practical exercise and they have us divided in groups.Fair grading. Mean is around B-.Online HW every week.

Things before "dynamics of rigid bodies" are covered in high school, so it is not hard to get started with this course. However, some content after "dynamics of rigid bodies" are deeper than that in high school; one'd better study hard to make sense of those content.The teacher is knowledgeable and usually asks questions during the class. However, when no one answers the questions, it results in an embarrassing situation, and the lecture stops progressing.
Sometimes the lecture is boring because it's easy; whereas sometimes it's hard to catch up with the professor since you're not familiar with the topic.
I recommend studying with the textbook to fully understand the content.
**The professor's words is not big, so you'd better sit as front as possible.knowledge based on DSE physics and calculus, not difficult. quite a lot of topic, one or two lessons will teach one topic.overall is ok, but sometimes it is boring and sleepy, maybe because i
take the morning session. with some experiment, sit front if you want to watch the experiment. no attendance will be taken in lecture. but some session will take attendance for the tutorial, my session does not take attendance, so I skip it all, but you can download the tutorial material with the answers in canvas. you can ask the TA if you do not understand the topic and question, if you can finish the tutorial material yourself, just skip it.
many people will ask question after the lesson.Some Force and motion, wave and heat from Dse but with deeper and different approach. Not to difficult to catch up but need some time to deal with it.
There are also some new ideas but they appear at the end of the semester and not included in Final as long as I remember.
If you are from DSE physics, you should able to catch up in classFollowing the lecture notes, with more explanations. It is fun to attempt classes. With some experiment in class, you may understand more. Even he proves the equations in class, you don't have to remember them, none of them will appear in Mastering Physics quiz or final. Also, you may ask him questions after class, he will kindly explain to you.Not that hard, similar to AP physics as far as I know. Topics include force and motion, as well as waves and thermodynamics, while equations used are not that different from those used in high school.Not particularly interesting, and may be a bit hard to grasp. The professor tried to make the lessons more interesting by being interactive and asking questions, which is great for students to revise some basic concepts of the topics.just read other reviews lah~ its "basic" stuff like newton's laws, kepler's laws, forces, angular momentum, torque, parallel axis theorem and all blah blah blahProf Sheng teaches in a simple, straight-forward manner which I personally appreciate from professors teaching such tough courses. His accent can be a bit difficult sometimes, but overall he spends time to clearly give examples to explain concepts. He spends time to focus on more important details than scare us with the math.
Compared to other prof I took this course with earlier (Choy Ting Pong), he is a lot more sorted and experienced with teaching. Prof Choy teaches well, but he emphasized a lot on the mathematical reasonings behind the physics, which does not benefit students who do not like math as much.Roughly half of the DSE covered topics will be taught in this course.

More difficult than DSE in my opinion.

In order to do well on exams and quizzes, you will need to do lots of exercises (provided by MasteringPhysics, an online platform where you get the access code by purchasing the textbook). To be honest, I have not used the textbook at all in my learning, so it may be up to you. But I felt that the notes can give you sufficient points to learn the basic concepts of the course.

In order to make sure your understanding is actually correct, I think the homework has to be done. MasteringPhysics will also provide extra questions later on in the course to allow you more questions for self practice, and they do NOT count towards your course grading.Good course instructor, enthusiastic. Worth going to the lectures, especially since there will be no lecture videos provided.

Tutor was alright, but I think the tutorials are just to consolidate your knowledge learnt from lectures. You must attend tutorials for the attendance marks, which are obtained by doing the in-tutorial tasks.Most of the content are taught in DSE physics, but with some new equations like wave equation, and new topics like thermodynamics.
Spend a reasonable time would be easy to follow up for those of the new things added.Teach normally, you will still learn something by attending to his lectures, some of the content/his point of view about the teaching stuff that are not included in the notes, which might help you to have better understanding of the topics.
The notes are just extracted from the text book but simplified. For me, it lacks of a lot details inside, so reading textbook is a much better option for me, however, it does consume more time to build up your own point of view.In the first half of the content(Force and Motion), it's just adding new concept on the fundamental physics you learned in secondary school.For another half(wave, heat), it is completely new for students and i think it's the hardest part in this course.his lessons is very interesting and his English is understandable.
He spends lots of time in prove and it does help you to understand the theorem.the content is quite similar to HKDSE standard with some more detail about mathematics behind and the proving of it . It is not hard for people who good at both maths and physic , (IE, if you are good at MATHS1013&1014 then you should be totally fine with most of the content.If you are having lessons with this instructor , you are luck.His teaching is comparatively less boring and most importantly, his English is understandable.
however, the tutorial section is kind of useless so i suggest you skip those if you will revise at home / hall
***For some of the tutorial , (actually only 1 tutor) require student to take attendance every lesson which will contribute 5% to your total skip tutorials at your own risk .The content of the a bit too difficult for students obtained a 4 in DSE as in the first half of the content may cover a slightly advance version of Force and motion. However, for the second half of the content, the material is mostly new to the majority of the student.The teaching of Altman is really good, he can make the class less boring compare to other class. The tutorial is also good for you as it will guide you through question you may or may not encounter before. You can learn the basics of the material through lecture and understand the principle of the questions and problems thorough the tutorial.Motions and Newton's laws

The laws of thermodynamicsOUTSTANDING!!!The materials before mid-term are generally covered in DSE curriculum. But you need to expect that would be more mathematical and deep. After the mid-term, the difficulty will surge exponentially and it also includes most of the challenging concept,He is a passionate professor who is eager to provide help and assistance to your question. But sometimes, he cannot provide a clear explanation on some of the concept and question, and some of the steps are not explicitly stated.Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics.

don't need to know much about calculus.

This course sustained my love for physics.My class is mainly taught by Prof. Altman. I think he is OK. The lectures can get a bit boring sometimes as his teaching pace is very slow and he had made mistakes in his notes which confused me.

Prof. Chen's teaching pace is very fast but he is able to explain things clearly.before midterm, it is same as the physics in HKDSE. after midterm, it will teaching some new field, such as angular mechanics and heat efficiency.it is interesting and it will show some experiment in calss. leung pak woo's course are morefocus on how to apply the knowledge. cheung man fung's course are more focus on how the equation come and its meaning. i suggest u to go both course to achieve better grade.Motions and Newton's laws

The laws of thermodynamicsDon't know about the lectures, cause I did not attend any class.

However, the tutorials are crap, they don't teach anything. They only upload a worksheet with a few questions on Canvas, and you are suppose to do the worksheet at home, if you come across any difficulty, then come to the tutorial to ask the TA. Otherwise, don't bother to go.N/AKey topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics.CMF is good as his prove is very clear and helpful to understanding.
Also, I think his written note is better materials to revise the topic than the original note.This course is available to students with adequate background in physics and basic calculus in high school. As such, the content would be a little more challenging than its non-calculus based counterpart, phys1111.

I found the structure of this course nice. The first few lectures enabled students to warm up and relearn concepts we should have learnt in high school. After that, the pace became considerably faster as it introduces new concepts such as rigid bodies mechanices, SHM, wave motions, and thermodynamices, none of which is covered in the HKDSE physics curriculum. Despite its fast pacing, I found the content easy to understand once you take time to fully digest it after lectures.The instructor has a easily-understandable accent, though it could be a bit strange at times. He seldom follows the lecture notes. Instead, he tends to derive the necessary and important results with his own methods, which in my opinion is more elegant and easier to understand. According to him, our class actually got the highest mean in both Test 1 and Test 2, so that should be a testimony of how good his teaching is.The course is pretty similar to the DSE physics but it's a harder version with some m2 stuff. (e.g. integration, vectors) It cover 3 main topics in 24 lectures, which are:

-Force and Motion
circular motion, newton's laws, rotation, angular momentum, gravitation

-Wave Motion
SHM, sound waves

-Thermodynamics (Heat)
Laws of thermodynamicsTerrible.
The professor is a foreigner and his accent is okay. But he is just speaking out the words from the slides without much elaboration. The teaching is one-sided and boring af. Basically the only advantage of attending the lecture is it gives you a chance for power napping. You can't learn anything from the lesson and almost half of the class disappeared after mid september lol. The tutor is a local teaching assistant and he teaches much better than the professor. No comment for the tutor as I only attended the first tutorial lesson.Just a in-depth version of DSE syllabus. As a former trainee of IPhO/ APhO HK team, the content is quite similar to those what I've learnt in the trainingQuite nice for Chen Tian Wen, I will get him B for that, tho I only attend the last lecture (haha). But really poor for that tutor and I will give him F. The questions for the tutorial was too easy, extremely different to the level of final examination.Also, the essence of that guy is really awful, his presentation skills was too poor that I can't understand him a word. So after joining 2 tutorial, I didn't join it anymore, as long as my tutorial do not count directly to my grade.[DSE Topic]

- First Law of Thermodynamics
- Second Law of Thermodynamics- Lecture VIdeos available within 3 days
- Professor Leung's explaination very good
- Need to buy textbook for online homeworkIt include many different topics. Most of them required you to use calculus to understand the  equations and answer the questions, like kinematics. The proof may also be useful as some questions in the exam may require you to do so, even if they are all in MC.

It also includes some basic vectors. Even if you have studied M2 before, you have to know how to apply it in Physics so it is not an easy stuff.

And as I have said, it include many different topics so you have to keep revising whenever one big topic is finished.

But overall, I believed these physics should be the basic things we have to learn. And I did learn something from it.There were 4 lecturers in 17 fall. I attended all of the 4 (if lecture video also count <-- Leung Pak Wo).

And the one I was originally attending was Professor Altman lecture. Frankly speaking, quite boring. I understand his passion to make us feel the interest of physics, but the learning style of Hong Kong may not suit his teaching style. He wants an active learning environment that we can't give. So the lecture becomes a bit awkward, and boring when he always try to wake us up, but not teaching.

Then I sat Chen Tian Wen lecture. And I stayed for quite a long time. He explained everything so clearly and were very willing to answer our questions after class.

As Leung Pak Wo posted up his lecture video on Canvas, I also kind of "attended" his lesson. His explanation was also very clear like Chen Tian Wen. He also gave the answer to questions in the lecture notes while the others might not always do so. But from the lecture video, it is easy to see that he didn't allow anyone using phone or sleeping, which is sth you have to consider if you want to attend his lecture. XD

At last, just being curious, I sat in Cheung Man Fung lecture when we started the topic about heat and thermodynamics. He really explained them very clearly and his explanations and examples helped me a lot in this topic.

There were also 4 help desk sessions before the final exam and 3 of the lecturers (except Professor Altman) were there to answer your questions. That is very useful and I highly recommend you to go if you have any concept unclear.

To sum up, the 3 local lecturers are all very good and you can try by yourselves to find the one suitable for you. For me, I think it should be Cheung Man Fung.1. Physical quantities, vectors & Motion in 2D

Emphasis on proving equations and theoryThe teaching contest is strictly closed to the syllabusStrong Chinese accent, for a common course, it is really difficult to teach more things out of class. So it is relatively meaningless to talk about the quality of teaching.Quite fair compared to your effort. Just like other common courses, the ratio of getting different grades is fixed.Some regular homework are assigned weekly. And you can find all the solutions by means of Chegg or some manuals. In order to get a  good grade, a relatively big workload should be imposed.This is a course for Engineering student admitted into first year and they require some preliminary understanding in Physics. Check the pre-requisite above for the course's requirements. The course syllabus is as follows:

- Physics quantity
- Newton's Law of Motion
- Work and Kinetic Energy
- Potential Energy and energy conversion
- Momentum, impulse and collision
- Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
- Angular Momentum
- Gravitation
- Periodic Motions
- Wave motions
- Thermal Properties
- Thermodynamics

If you have the textbook purchased, you will find that for the first few lectures, Dr. CHEN goes over a whole chapter in the book so the content itself might not be well covered. Purchasing the textbook is a must for online homework submission. I don't know much about the DSE syllabus but speaking from the IB graduate's point of view, a lot of the content here has already been slightly covered, especially the Dynamics of Rigid Bodies (Engineering - Option B). This course aims to show how a lot of the formulae in the topics are derived and used from Calculus so I personally don't find it hard to understand the calculus concepts in the course.

But, since there are a lot of concepts covered in the course, it might overwhelm you. Think twice before joining the course because there are lot more courses to choose from to satisfy the fundamental courses. I sometimes find it hard to understand the concept and use them efficiently in tests and homework.Dr. CHEN can sometimes be funny in the lectures. His teaching is clear and he often follows what is on the lecture notes. But, he always does a lot of proofs on the whiteboard and explain how such formula is derived. Although proofs are important for understanding, the final formula are always the ones to remember. There are always demonstrations at the end of the lecture and he's also keen to answer your questions after the lecture ends.Cover most of the DSE physics with addition of a few topics (e.g. rigid body, entropy)

SUPER HARD, even I got both 5* in M2 and Physics in HKDSE, still found it freaking difficult.

Wait till the test and final to see how's the resultPro Chen is a passionate professor, although most of the time he will just stick on his notes. Also, the experiments done in the class always failed lol.

Pro Leung is also good, but does not really follow the notes.Lots of DSE stuff included in the quiz, especially the first one. Better to study hard if haven't take physics as on of your high school electives.nice professor but maybe i m just the kind of person that love to read the notes on my ownfair to get a C for me without any DSE physics knowledgehave to attend tutorial which account for part of your final grade
have to finish the online exercise from time to time, and there can be difficult questions sometimes which waste you plenty of time. Besides, there are also supplementary exercise provided online. but it just seems that you wont get enough time to finish them all unless you burn midnight oil and yet m not that kind of personI can compare it with HKDSE PHYS.
HKDSE PHYS helps, but not too much.
You must get at least both 3 in PHYS and M1/M2 in order to enter this course.

You will use a lot of Maths, so you should work hard on it. It is recommended that you do most of the textbook chapter exercises.

It is easy to say that there are a lot of things you haven't learnt in HKDSE, you have to work so hard and try to do more exercises, so that you can get a better and a better grade.

Overall, useful content! Lots of online materials will be provided in our lecture.The lessons are quite exciting.
The teaching is effective and he uses his own notes to teach. He writes on the whiteboard and teaches.
He explains some phenomenons and derives many formulas, which can be clearly understood.
Dr. Cheung will teach quite fast so you should have a strong foundation in Maths/M2.
You should not miss any lessons because you will miss a lot of things he teaches.

He demonstrates experiments and then explains why it happens, and also he derives equations to support his explanation.

You may ask questions after classes. He is very nice and he explains precisely and clearly to you.

He is passionate in teaching. You should try to sit in the front and learn more :)
Definitely give an 'A'.

Tutors are definitely above average, not extremely good, but he explains things well. Maybe everyone is sleepy at 9am...Some basic physics concept like dynamics, rotation, wave and thermo. The wave and thermo is really tricky, which means that in the second half of the semester, the workload significantly increase.The Chinese accent is really impressive. Others quite well.
The instructor can demonstrate many concepts in class, which makes the class more interesting. However, sometimes the atmosphere of the whole class tend to be really boring and I just tend to feel sleepythe content is really good, and the lecture note is very useful. we are suggested to print out the lecture note so that we can add our own notes.the instructor is really good at explaining. It is really fun when he is explaining, he also gives us some demonstration for the topic we are learning.I just attended the class once, so i don't know really much about the grading system.I haven't have any homework, so I don't know much about the workload, sorry.Key topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics.The lectures might be a little boring, but the demonstrations of experiments are really interesting.Topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics.
1st test. Motion and work (rotation is the most difficult part)
2st test. Wave and sound
Final. Thermodynamics1. Wanna Sleep!
Just read PPT…
2. Students present in class decrease gradually
3. The prof can't express what he wants to say efficiently.
4. English not goodThe content is okay for students who have studied Physics in secondary school. Almost half of the content was taught in secondary school. I studied IB Physics, and it was fine for me.Lecture notes are not so different from secondary school textbooks. The tutorial class helps you by telling you how to solve the problem step by step.Though some topics are included in high school syllabus, they can be quite difficult.Did not go to lessonI think it is quite good
Assignments 5%
Tutorials     5%
Test 1         20%
Test 2         20%
Final Exam 50%

I just meet mean in every test and sometimes below,
(there are two tests and they serve as midterm.)
final : 26/40
Finally got a B-Quite a lot to do.
Mastering physics spend you a lot of time every week.
Some class have tutorial and you need to attend lessons and do some paper work in class in order to get that 5%.
I think the tutorial is not useful btw.Overall, the content was not too broad, and was as would be expected from an introductory Physics course. Although this course does include Calculus, approximately ten percent of questions include calculus, and usually for simple things such as determining acceleration given a velocity equation or for calculating power. Most of the course's difficulty lies in algebraic problems as they often require many more steps than the calculus based problems. The most difficult topics were most likely heat and it's transfer along with oscillations.The Teaching was very good, as my teacher spoke excellent English and worked through many problems and concepts on the whiteboard in each class session. The tutorials also proved quite helpful and were very important for understanding key concepts.The content is quite good. The professor's English is fluent and there are interesting demostration in class. He can explain a concept or formula clearly.The teaching is acceptable, but to have a better command of the knowledge, you'd better do more practice.It /is very difficult to get A+ (requiring 100% in the spring semester). However, to get A range is not so tough if you have 85%.The workload is median. There are 2 quizs in total (both can retake); around 11 assignments online. If you listen carefully in the class, it does not take too much time to review.I was required to take this in spring as I need to have calculus background by taking math1012 in fall first.
IF YOU CAN TAKE IT IN FALL, TAKE IT IN FALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SPRING IS A DISASTER!!!!!!!!!!!
As the course contents was covered in most other reviews, I will not go in too much detail in this review.
Mechanics 65%, Waves 5%, Heat 30%.
There are 2 tests that use a computer to grade it.
Before the first test, it is mostly HKDSE stuff with some calculus (vector, diffrentiation, integration).
After first test, new stuff like dynamics of rigid body begin to emerge, angular momentum, etc.
It is suggested to preview the stuff as early as possible.
Thermodynamics will be another disaster.
Be sure to catch up the pace fast enough.SHENG Ping was actually just reading out loud from the lecture notes. Recommend CHEUNG Man Fung's lecture instead. His tutorials are good.quit difficult ,the content is much more than the content in secondary school. Because of english-medium, you much to work very hard if your physics is learned by Chinese.my tearcher is a professer from China , he's teaching is no goodVery difficult for those student who have no basis but just take phys1001 , but it is compulsory for some major requirement , if you want to get a good grade , you have to spend a lot of time . If you can do well in DSE physics , you can just review with little time and focus on new things .He explains physical phenomenon and prove formula in detail , it is very dynamic and interesting , but only conclusion we should use .Most of the content is taught in secondary school. For those who are familiar with differentiation and integration, the course content will be easier for them.Overall teaching is not bad. Additional explanations on the course material are useful for the revisions before mid-terms and finals. The lecturer is also willing to answer all sorts of questions after the lecture.Actually similar with the HKDSE syllabus, you can apply it to the course so I do not think the content is that hard. You can study it through tutorial thoughCheung did a good job by explaining lots of physics concepts.
Tutorial are useful to understand the concepts behind.Did not do well in the miterm and final exam, and finally got a B-.
Midterm and final exam included around 10 question, and I just know around 5-6 of them.i hate mastering physics, but nothing left other than that.Before midterm----80% contents same as dse physics
After midterm----AL Physics

Lecture notes--->90% contents are dragged from book, providing simple introduction of topics. Explanations inside the book are too lengthy. However, reading the book is still useful to know and clarify important concepts.Quite clear but boring.
Sometimes encourage us do not giving up :)

Tutorial : Not necessary but a good approach if you want to ask questionit combines almost 2 years of high school physics and some calculus in only one sem. Therefore it may be diffcult for those who are weak in phy.Cheung Man Fung is the best teacher. must go to class or it is very hard to followif you want to get higher grade do well in the two midterm. they are much easier. And this year Exam is extremely hard and who gets higher marks in midterm gets higher grade.homework once a week. The questions are hard to do but can be googledA little bit too much content
Quite difficult
need to spend much time to digest the contentCheung Man Fung is excellent
teaching is good and clear
sometimes with experiments shown2 test 1 final
Test 1 mean
Test 2 mean
Final above mean 1 sd
Overall grade A-Every week has one online assignment (5%)
Tutorial is compulsory (5%)
Test 1 and Test 2 have retest
(if the retest is worse then the previous test then not counting the retest otherwise take the 2 average)
Final all are MC questions
but quite difficult MC and this year have some out syl questions (finally add point to everyone)DSE Physics with calculus explainations, mainly mechanics
some topics on rotation,
simple harmonic motion,
and thermodynamicsThe lecturer's teaching is quite clear though boring. His accent is understandable. He draws and writes everything on the whiteboard instead of using boring lecture notes ppt.

The tutorial session is totally unnecessary because the TA's teaching sucks and no attendance will be counted.
You can simply skip all lectures and tutorial if you study the whole book yourself. There will be no difference at all.DSE Physics with calculus explainations, mainly mechanics
some topics on rotation,
simple harmonic motion,
and thermodynamics

There will be advantages for those who studied M2 because so many concepts are explained using calculus and vectors. Sometimes you can simply use these maths to solve problems.
eg. calculating torque using cross productThe lecturer's teaching is quite clear though boring. His accent is understandable. He draws and writes everything on the whiteboard instead of using boring lecture notes ppt.

The tutorial session is totally unnecessary because the TA's teaching sucks and no attendance will be counted.
You can simply skip all lectures and tutorial if you study the whole book yourself. There will be no difference at all.Just some secondary school physics knowledge (before midterm) (easy)
Some AL physics knowledge (after midterm) (hard)

It's talking about Gas and ForceMr. Law 's lessons are not boring.
But I couldn't get the knowledge very well from his lessons

Textbook is very usefulIt would be better if you have a better foundation in M2.
for me , it just likes the combination of high school physics +AL +m2His speaking was easy for students to follow his teaching. He is a nice person and you can try to ask him question and he will answer you kindly.
you can even try to play the demostration after the lesson.Almost all content has been taught in high school and it is not difficult. Some really hard parts will not be covered in exams.Quite boring to be honest. Willing to help students to solve their problems after lectures. But actually you can study on your own. The lecture notes are enough for study.A little bit challenging but  acceptable. Nonetheless, the final exam is difficult, it is not common that you find lots of questions that you dont knowL4-L6 have good tutorial helping you revise some important content, which will take attendance. However, the progress of lecture is much more faster than the tutorial, thus lots of chapter will not be taught.-Motions and Newton's laws
-Work and energy
-Conservation of energy and momentum
-Rotation
-Rigid body
-Simple harmonic and damped oscillations
-Forced oscillations
-Standing waves and sound waves
-Kinetic theory
-The laws of thermodynamics

Some may learnt in secondary school.Cheung Man Fung is a good lecturer. Usually there will be a little experiment after classes.Force and motion, Energy, Rigid body, Gravitation, Periodic motion, Wave, Thermodynamics.

If you have studied physics in secondary school, you will be familiar with more than half of the terms/topics in the course. And if you think you can skip half of the lectures and tutorials, you will be very sorry. The twist of physics with CALCULUS is a very big one. You may be able to get away with it in the first test, but you will be in deep trouble in the latter tests and exams. Make sure you do more questions and understand well about the physics with CALCULUS (well the physics part as well).

I give it an A as you can learn quite a lot of new things and topics in reasonable depth in the course. How much you can understand is another thing.Really don't want to name anyone just guess. The lecturer pretty much copied from the notes, with some exceptionally advanced level proves, and explained with some heavily accented English which you will need some time to adapt to. If you are lucky to have choose his lectures, make sure you are well prepared before the lectures, or else you will not be able to understand a single thing in his class, and give up his lessons fairly easily and quickly like me.

Tutor is more easy to understand and teach you more practical skills to solve exam problems. Mr Jacky is a fairly hea but cheerful tutor who is always willing to help you in and after class.Summarized below:
Physical quantities, vectors, 2D motions, Newton's Laws(3 laws, relative motion, reference frame, friction, circular motion) Energy(Work, Kinetic, Potential, conservation), Momentum(Collisions, Impulse, conservation, center of mass), Dynamics of rigid bodies(Moment of inertia, rotation KE, angular motions, torque, angular momentum), Gravitation(Gravitational force and PE, planetary motions, spherical mass distribution, apparent weight), Periodic motion(Simple harmonic motion, pendulums, damped and forced oscillations, resonance), Wave motion(Mathematics, power, reflection, standing wave, sound, Doppler effect), Temperature and heat(Thermal expansion, heat capacity, latent heat, heat transfer), Kinetic Theory, Thermodynamics(1st and 2nd law, heat engines, type of thermodynamic processes, thermodynamic properties of ideal gas, entropy)

Tutorial sessions are about doing practice problems in small groups, including 'warm-up exercises', 'basic practice' and 'context-rich problems'.Dr. Cheung clearly shows his passion on teaching. He does almost all proofs of the theorems/formulas patiently and clearly, then address them with more daily-life examples, allow us to understand even more mathematically complex concepts. He is also willing to discuss physics concepts with us after lectures, no matter are they out of syllabus or not. Of course, his proofs are not very useful in doing homework and exam questions, but it's still worth to learn them as the brush up/tidy up your physics concepts. Students who want to major PHYS must not miss his lectures and proofs.

Dr. Ko is the tutor in tutorial sessions. He can guide us to the right path to solve the physics problems in tutorials without telling us the exact answer/steps skillfully.it is hard if u didint study M2
the content is difficult, it is good if you studied the ebook or ask the professor after lesson. the tutorial is quite useless, the tutor taught something very different from lecture.  so, attend the lecture instead of tutorial.professor is good
he explains most of the details but speed too fastIf you are not forced to study this, don't register this course.
There are 2 divided parts, L1-3 and L4-6, with the difference that whether tie tutorials count marks. L1-3 doesn't and L4-6 does.Cheung Man Fung is a great teacher, his testament for those theory is awesome. And the TA is marvellous as well.DSE syllabus is mostly covered. How the equations is derived will be explained.Use powerpoints with supplementary exercises and related experiments. Clear explanations by professors. Weekly tutorials provide chances to have in-depth discussions on each topic.It is quite similar to DSE syllabus but excluding electricity and magnetic. So it is pretty easy for who take physics in high school.

Motions and Newton's laws
Work and energy
Conservation of energy and momentum
Rotation
Rigid body
Simple harmonic and damped oscillations
Forced oscillations
Standing waves and sound waves
Kinetic theory
The laws of thermodynamicsCheung Man Fung is a good lecturer who gives many concrete examples to illustrate complicated concepts.

The tutorials are usually useless if you can fully understand the stuff taught in the lecture. The quality of the tutorial depends on the tutor.highschool stuff : Newton's laws, momentum, KE,circular motion,  wavemotion, heat capacity, ideal gas law
not highschool stuff :angular momentum, torque,simple harmonic motion, more wavemotion, more heat capacity more ideal gas law

the calculus is very very very simple, just polynormal, simple sin/cos differentiation/integrationCMF is a super good instructor, explain things in great detail, he fills the whiteboard with info when he is teaching but in a tidy way, really gives me the motivations to start dropping down my own study note as I follow along and is incredibly helpful. I was really lucky to have him as my first physics instructor and I thank him so much.

The tutorial class requires attendance for this semester, I don't know about the future ones...The content maybe a little bit difficult for students who are not so good in physics and calculus as the course really need a good background of those subjectsThe instructor is good, he will explain the proof of the formula and the experiment in class was quite interestingThe grading is very straight, if you get mean score then you get C+, that means you just need to work hard then you can get good gradeThe major workload comes from the web homework, which may be frustrating if you do not have any reference to do with.Closely related to physics content in secondary school.
It is easier to catch up for those had physics background.Quite interesting teaching. Students cannot use electronic devices in the class. Whether good or bad, it depends individually.The scores i got were all around mean score.
Finally got an A-a piece of online homework per week
The instructor used two tests to replace the mid term test.
No attendance required in lectures. But you have to attend tutorial classes to get some extra marks. You wont get a fail if you skip those tutorials.Physical quantities, vectors & Motion in 2D

Thermal properties of matter
Laws of ThermodynamicsI skipped all lessonLots of topics included that you probably cannot handle it in just one semester. Some are high schools topics, but the new topics are qutie difficult.
Some of the topics:
Simple harmonic and damped oscillations
Forced oscillations
Standing waves and sound waves
Kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics.Mr. Jo's English is not quite easy to understand and his explanation is quite complicated and not clear enough.Topics includes Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics.
In my opinion, in was difficult to fully understand the concept, so it is hard to answer the test problems.The lecturer explains the topic well, elaborately explains the formulas etc. He likes to demonstrate some examples in the note in class.
The TA gives practice questions every week and discuss them, but the questions were relatively easy compared to the homework and tests.Physics from high school + more definition and explanation
some new topics which is not really difficultdefinition, steps to obtain the formula, when and how to use the formulas, some small experiments. You may say that's boring but I think it's good enough for a physics lecture.Topics include:
Physical quantities, vectors & Motion in 2D
Newton's laws of motion
Work and kinetic energy
Potential energy and energy conservation
Momentum, impulse and collision
Dynamics of rigid bodies
Angular momentum
Gravitation
Periodic motion
Wave motion and sound
Temperature and heat
Thermal properties of matter
Laws of Thermodynamics
The content was quite excessive and difficult for an introductory, Common Core course.The professor explained concepts well, but the lectures were a bit boring and monotonous. The professor and TAs are always open to any questions and doubts though and are very helpful.This course talks about topics such as Mechanics, Waves and Thermodynamics, and a lot of them has been covered in high school. Although the course name has 'calculus', it actually doesn't require much calculus.Although Prof. Jo talked a bit slow, he managed to reveal the details as clearly as possible. Worth attending to his lectures!Basically, it's the name. Physics plus calculus. it's basically the physics class you will have in you high school with addition of Calculus involving in it. I have to say it's pretty hard.Mr. Jo is not really good. Although I know he taught a lot for a certain day, I cannot really understand what he is really talking about, I have to look back the video.It covers a little bit of the HKDSE physics, maybe the topic is the same, such as heat, mechanics, wave, etc.
The contents it cover is harder and wider, so be careful.Dr. Leung is a great professor, he teach physics with his passions and i didn't feel bored when i was attending his lectures.not difficult to understand but the questions in the exam are sometime quite complicated. The tutorial section is super useful, if you are planning to study this course by just read the notes, then you better go to the tutorial every week to check if your concept is correct or  not. I don't remember the name of my tutorial's instructor, but she is good, explain things very clear and she even will have a small review about the stuff taught every week. So actually just attend the  tutorial section is enough already.I study this course by reading the notes only, since my lesson is on 9am, every time I go there and end up with fall as sleep, so I don't really know how the lecturer's teaching was. But you don't need to worry much since it will have lecture video for this course so you don't really need to take the lecture.The book is good enough as a study material but additional youtube videos may be required as all concepts are not covered in lectures.LEUNG, Pak Wo- good teacher, interactiveGrading for test's in L3 and L4 is bad
mcq or numerical input test's and losing marks is really easyWeekly graded hw.
L3 and L4 have test 1 and test 2 instead of mid terms. they also have re test to improve grades and take mean of both test if retake has a higher score than test.Good content with lecture note provided. This course managed to provide deeper understanding for physics based on high school physics and added in calculus element which is crucial for further study in engineering major.Instructor paid much effort to provide best teaching, but sometimes the progress was too fast so many students couldn't manage to cope.The first 10 lectures are similar to dse , then the other 13 lectures are new. The content are not too complicated if you have spend time on it doing the online homework and tutorials.Pretty good ascent, but not helping with the teaching.  Although you know every word he said, you just can't get the idea. So i just went to class a few times.Topics are really similar to high school physics. Just more conceptual, maybe.For me lectures are so so boring and i dont understand a thing.
Tutorials are much better. L3 L4 tutorials are different from that of L1 L2 L5 L6 ( tutorial attendance are graded + 2 tests before final instead of one midterm). Both of the teaching systems have their +-
L3 L4 provide a retake for each test. But that means 4 tests in a term. It can be quite hectic if you have other midterms going on as well.The contents before the mid term include mainly DSE mechanics. Contents after the mid terms include all topic of the book excluding fluid mechanics.( including some new topics in waves,Doppler effects, gravitation(astronomy elective in DSE), moment of inertia, Angular  momentum)Cheung Man Fung is a good teacher. His teaching is clear and concise. I really enjoy his lectures. I would really recommend attending his lectures as he uses his own notes which in my opinion more clear and concise the lectures on the course webpage.Nothing to learn except for thermodynamics (in which only the basics of it is taught). Don't be fooled that this course is for students with calculus backgrounds, there was not a single question regarding integration/differentiation in the midterm and final exams. Students with 5** in physics are strictly recommended to take PHYS1312, where they can actually learn physics.Prof. Chen is generally good at explaining physical concepts  and is proficient in English, Cantonese and Mandarin alike. However, his classes are quite boring and he's humorous in an awkward way in his demonstrations. Still, he knows the common mistakes students tend to make (eg. messing up "work done on" and "work done by") and gives good emphasis on them.The content was basically the same stuff that we did in high school, with topics like kinematics, rotation, sound, waves and thermodynamics.He is definitely among the best professors that I have had in this university. He spends a good amount of time on all the required concepts in the course, and a good amount of time on the questions. he has a very understandable accent and he did a great job in my opinion.Key topics includes: Newton's laws of motion, Momentum, Rigid bodies, Gravitation, Periodic motion, Wave and Heat.

More than a half of the topics is in the syllabus of DSE. Although there is the word "calculus" in the course name, you can just ignore it.

As a business student, I have studied both PHYS1002, 1003 and 1112. I think PHYS1112 is the easiest course among the three common cores. In fact, I found there were a number of business students taking this course too.A good local professor. Detailed explanation and clear pronunciation of English compared to other physics professors. It was quite lively and interesting when he was answering questions after class using Cantonese.

The pace of teaching, however, was very slow that he explained everything in details even some of them are just simple concepts.It mainly talks about Force and Motion in physics.
Wave is WAY MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE PAST
You will also learn about moment of inertia in this course.

It is easy for students who did good in physics at past.Extremely good professor. There will be some demonstrations during the lecture, and the professor himself is able to explain the concepts in force and motion clearly.
Also, the professor can maintain a good learning atmosphere, and encourage us to think more about physics.
Don't skip classes because it is fun to attend his lectures!!!This course first introduces force and motion which you have learnt in high school. Other topics include gravitation, wave, optics, heat, thermodynamics. It covers a lot of topics in physics but it will not let you study the topics in a deeper way.He teaches quite good with one to two experiments performed by him in class. However, the lecture is quite boring. It is easy to fall asleep. You can choose not to attend the lecture if you are familiar with those topics since he just talks about the proof of some formulas. For the tutorial, the problems given are useful and can be used for practice. There are also some PRS questions in class but they are not counted in grade.Thermodynamic, mechanics and sound wave with calculus.
Something like physics in DSE, but with some calculus calculation.Very few practical calculations in the lectures, mainly proof of formulae.
Tutorial will deal with practical problems mainly.Mid-Term and Final Exam are all MCQs. They will be a little bit harder than the HW.
HW is counted towards final grading for ~10%
Study PHYS1112 in Fall is recommended since the grading in spring is really poor.There was online HW every week. The questions were basically questions in the textbook, but with some changed parameters. The number of trials of questions are limited and marks will be deducted if your answer is wrong.Basic dynamics and thermodynamics are included. The wave and thermodynamics parts are a little bit confusing at first but with practice, one can do them proficiently.
Tutorial classes are not very popular, because they are simply doing exercises.
The help desk service is quite helpful though, where you can get some one-to-one help from teaching assistants.Prof. WONG is quite poor in delivering lectures. He seemed unable to explain things clearly and he preferred to write some important points/steps on board with very little explanation. But he is quick in replying to emails and very patient and open to questions. He would randomly ask questions to those sitting in the front.
Prof. WANG is another way of teaching. He would talk through the entirety of the lecture without much interaction. He can explain things clearly and fully but one will have to follow him carefully or s/he will get lost quite soon.Not far from HKDSE Physics syllabus but with some deeper and more detailed content especially in the topics of wave and heat
Calculus is sometimes required to derive the equations but the calculus required in exam is simpleCHEN Tian Wen is one of the best instructor I experienced in my first semester. Fluent and good English which is quite easy to listen to. There are many demonstrations, one for each lecture on average. We had finished the syllabus one lesson less than scheduled so he arranged an extra tutorial to us instead. Quite a capable and responsible instructor......enough for you to survive in society and tell others you know what is physicsVery good grade ......You can get a A grade easily if you have studied before exam as there are so many student did not learn physics before and some of them are very lazy.......
Tips: Do all extra practice question on mastering physics 90% questions in the exam are easier than them Don't waste the 300 dollars Always check the question on mastering physic in Google If you really can't understand the lecture don't hesitate just do more practice Practice makes good grade300 dollars for the online homework code u must buy it
1 hr per week for online homework
1.5hr per week for the stupid tutorial ( u don't need to mind what they are saying u are free to do anything of course I recommend u to revise the notes)
1 day per quiz or examDSE stuff + extra mechanics + thermodynamics

interesting teaching but cant be applied in exams/ quiz

tutorial notes is ok
look at the problems once and you will have a better grasp of the conceptnothing special, mainly high school stuff, e.g. mechanic, wave, heat, but it will be difficult after the 1st quiz.not directly refer to the PPT, but use his own examples to explain the theory
he often demonstrate experiments during the lecture
but he is not loud enough, maybe a little bit difficult to followMost of them are HKDSE syllabus, it's easy to follow.Professor is quite good, normally you can understand what he's talking about. Easy to follow since you have learnt them in your high school.Generally not good. You have to work very hard so that you can get a high grade in this course.High, there is a homework every week. You have to buy a physics textbook and register the Mastering Physics system to hand in the assignment every week, but it does not account for a high percentage in the course.The content  is not difficult because 50%is the content of. HKDSE,some newthings about mechanical energyThe teaching is so good and clear.The teacher will give some example to help you understand the definition.Also,the tutor require group work.And you will be divided in different groups which found in 3people and you will finish some easy and difficult quedtions together.if you listen carefully about what the instructor say, nothing is diffcult. remember to go to the tutorial class. there are many queation for you to do. all of them are useful.quite goodthis course is not optional to choose, and this is a difficult version of PHYS1001, however, if you study physics at secondary school then you must attend this course automaticallyreally badThe content is about learn physics in general life. The contents are okay. But not quite deep for the subject, and some parts of the subject isn't very clear.Quite good, but sometimes the professor isn't pay attention to the class condition. Sometimes he taught really boring.Good grading, if you get mean in mid-term and final exam will still be okay, around B range grade.The workload is okay. Just homework every week and another tutorial class to help you understand more of the subjects.The PHYS1112 content includes mainly Mechanics  and Heat.
Topics include:
Newton's Laws of motion
Circular motion
Gravitational
Moment of inertia
Simple Harmonic Motion
Heat

Some of them are reviews from HKDSE Physics, with new topics which are essential for further studies on Physics or EngineeringCHEUNG man Fung is excellent in explaining concepts from the theory, for every equation he will prove it on class thoroughly. He is willing to answer questions after lectures as well (given that you are actively asking him questions)mostly HKDSE physics explained in calculus way but not much assignment/ exam / quiz need to actually use calculuschoy ting pong is very enthusiastic at teaching, he will answer every question after class if you have any.
And he is actually quite funnynot bad if you are good at HKDSE physics and you will need to have a little bit of calculis background in order to understand the contents since most of the proves contains integration/ differentiation.one masteringphysics assignment per week

funny prof.PHYS 1111 and PHYS 1112 target students who have learned the most basic knowledge in physics in high school. Students with more advanced physics background should consider taking PHYS 1312. PHYS 1112 employs a calculus-based approach. Students without knowledge of calculus should take PHYS 1111 instead. Key topics include motions and Newton’s Laws, work and energy, conservation of energy and momentum, rotation, rigid body, simple harmonic and damped oscillations, forced oscillations, standing waves and sound waves, kinetic theory and the laws of thermodynamics. For students under the 4-year degree only. Students without the physics prerequisite but have taken PHYS 1001 or equivalent, and/or without the mathematics prerequisite but have taken MATH 1013/ MATH 1020/ MATH 1023 or equivalent may seek instructor’s approval for enrolling in the course.Very good professor, teaches very well with clear concept.  Concise lecture materialsEssential:
Special relativity
Quantum mechanics
Atoms and molecules

Additional (optional):
General relativity
Action/Lagrangian Mechanics
Quantum information/entanglement
Statistical physics/entropy
Condensed matter
Complexity
Nuclear and particle physics
Cosmology

Essential content will be used to determine your general grade, with the exception of the A range sub-grades. If your score from the essential part is high enough to reach A range, then your A sub-grade (e.g. A-, A, A+) will be determined from the additional content.

The main essential topics are special relativity and quantum mechanics. Special relativity was quite easy, but I found the later parts of quantum mechanics to be quite difficult. The derivations used in atoms and molecules is also very hard to follow.

The additional topics may in fact be easier than than most of the essential topics (with the exception of special relativity, which is the easiest). However, not all additional topics will be taught. During 2017-18 fall, only general relativity, action, quantum information/entanglement, and statistical physics/entropy were taught as the additional topics, as there wasn't enough time to cover the others.

As there are so many different topics, there is a LOT of content covered in this course (although not too deep). Because of this, it may be difficult to keep up with the lectures' contents unless you revise after every single topic.Prof. Wang is very enthusiastic in his teaching and encourages students to ask questions. He often stays behind after lectures for students to ask him questions. His lectures are quite interesting as he often includes short anecdotes and jokes.

However, sometimes it is difficult to keep up with the mathematical derivations that he writes on the whiteboard.Syllabus:
1. Special relativity (6, E)
2. General relativity (1, A)
3. From action to laws of nature (2, A)
4. Quantum mechanics (5, E)
5. Quantum information (2, A)
6. Atoms and molecules (2, E)
7. Statistical physics (2, A)
8. Condensed matter (2, A, IF)
9. Complexity (1, A, IF)
10. Nuclear and particle physics (2, A, IF)
11. Cosmology (1, A)

Numbers in mean the expected number of lectures for each topic. Letter E means "Essential" part and letter A means "Advanced" part (these decide grading). Remark IF means only taught if time permits.

"Essential" material is pretty much all covered in Prof. Wang's lecture notes. "Advanced" material would require you own further reading for better understanding. In our semester, the "IF" topics were not taught.Prof. Wang is very enthusiastic and engaging in teaching. He tries to explain the physics in an accessible way, due to the low prequisite requirements on the course. However, some relevant knowledge in mathematics (linear algebra and differential equations) would be helpful for understanding derivations.Here is the Syllabus:
1. Special relativity (6, essential)
2. General relativity (1, advanced)
3. From action to laws of nature (2, advanced)
4. Quantum mechanics (5, essential)
part 0. introduction 8
5. Atoms and molecules (2, essential)
6. Statistical physics (3, essential)
7. Condensed matter (2, advanced)
8. Complexity (1, advanced)
9. Nuclear and particle physics (2, advanced)
10. Cosmology (1, advanced)

The number indicates the number of lectures planned to cover the topic.
As you can see, too many topics are planned to be covered, so the professor just finish the topic 1-6,The professor is very enthusiastic, always teaching with an amazing smile. Although there are too many points to be addressed, he tried his best to explain everything clearly. No textbook. Only the professor's own notes were used.Almost all branches of physics were being attempted to go through. However, professor ended up just going through a few, including SR, QM, Thermodynamics.

Course attempts to introduce students to all of these wonderful physics, but ended up making things brief and shallow. Everything seemed like a rush and pretty much nothing was being learnt in class.Professor has passion, but fails to establish an effective way to teach the class. With the prerequisite of PHYS1114, it's pretty much impossible to keep up with the extensive maths being taught.

Gave a C purely because he's really passionate, but in my opinion, the learning sequence is a complete mess.Topics include:

1. Special relativity (6, E)
2. General relativity (1, A)
3. From action to laws of nature (2, A)
4. Quantum mechanics (5, E)
5. Atoms and molecules (2, A)
6. Statistical physics (3, E)
7. Condensed matter (2, A)
8. Complexity (1, A)
9. Nuclear and particle physics (2, A)
10. Cosmology (1, A)

The last 4 (topics 7 - 10) were not covered as there was no time.
The number in brackets shows how many lectures for each topics, and the letter 'E' means Essential, 'A' means Advanced. Essential topics are supposed to decide the grade between A, B, C,... and Advanced is to decide between A+, A, and A-.

Like the other reviews have said, I am not sure what is the objective of this course... Very scattered and confused. There was no point in having the complicated Essential and Advanced topics structure. It should have just been 2 topics - special relativity and quantum mech. The level of the content is also very unclear. Some of the stuff is basic, but most of it is too complex for a 2000-level course and also requires advanced math which is not a prerequisite for this course.

I have no idea why PHYS 1114 is a prerequisite for this course because this does not relate to that in any way. And also don't understand why this course is a prerequisite for PHYS 3071, and why this course is included in the Astrophysics and Cosmology Minor.He is a nice guy, but he messed up the structure, exams, and grading of this course.

The lectures and lecture notes are not helpful to prepare for the exams or complete the assignments. Most of the questions are completely different which you have never seen before.

Tutorials are a waste of time. Just attend 1 week's tutorial when you need to give your presentation, don't bother with the others.- Special relativity
- General relativity
- Quantum mechanics
- Atoms and molecules
- Thermal and statistical physics

His notes are very confusing. There's no problem solving at all. Mostly tedious derivations.

The goal of this course is extremely unclear.

The midterm had an extremely difficult SR problem. And he tested us on how to derive the Einstein field equations from the principle of least action.

In the final, he asked us to do quantum field theory (only the rudiments though, so it is more like an exercise on manipulating symbols. So I don't see the point of that problem.)He is a nice person and I do admire his passion.

However I learned literally nothing from this course.Prof Wang introduced a variety of concepts, most of which, however, are not in depth due to limited timeTeaching with HEART <3 <3. This is Prof Wang's first lesson. I think overall he taught well.Very good grading. The mean should fall into A. If you are above mean, you should get an A+ easily. Exams are not very hard, but number of questions are quite few that if you make a silly mistake, you will get very low mark.Only three assignments throughout the semester. There will be one quiz in each tutorial, but they are not hard.Unlike prof. Du spending most lecture time on relativity and quantum mechanics. Prof. Wang cover much more topic which really makes this course "introduction to modern physics". Topic include (number of lecture time):
- Introduction (1)
- Action Principle (1)
- Special Relativity (5)
- General Relativity (1)
- Quantum Mechanics (5)
- Atom & Molecule Physics (1)
- Condensed Matter (2)
- Statistical Physics (2)
- Complexity (1)
- Nuclear & Particle Physics (1)
- Cosmology (1)

and emphasise the topic with   which count about 90% of the final grade and the remaining 10% is the topic ofProf. Wang combine different topics from different books for writing his own lecture notes and sometimes with some jokes on it, e.g. after the lecture of action principle, he said many students complaint to him the topic is too difficult and he draw a deer without eyes to represent them (meaning no idea), after that he further explain more on the topic and said those students are now becoming a deer without eyes and legs (meaning still no idea). And he also explain the topic quite clearly with example.

He is also willing to answer students' question in different method (a editable note on canvas,  also his facebook account)

However, he expected us to have a better mathematics background while most students start taking the multi-calculus and linger algebra  at the same semester which sometimes students may get confuse on the maths used in the lecture.the course content include so many modern physics topic being studied from twenty century. eg: special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanic, statistical physics, Cosmology... He  gave lots of detail in each topic. Honestly, it would be an awesome lecture to those physics major student who is really love physics, but it would be a nightmare to others. The course content can give you the most updated thing in the field of modern physics. But you have to study so many topic in this course.Prof. Wang yi is one of the passionate teacher I ever met in UST. He always trying to make a relax atmosphere. I can believe that he spend lots of time to think the joke which can catch our attention before and after the class. He provided the lecture video    on the canvas in order to allow the student reviewing any miss content in the course. Besides, he have a very clear and well organised explanation.Topics:
1. Special relativity (6, E)
2. General relativity (1, A)
3. From action to laws of nature (2, A)
4. Quantum mechanics (5, E)
5. Atoms and molecules (2, A)
6. Statistical physics (3, E)
7. Condensed matter (2, A)
8. Complexity (1, A)
9. Nuclear and particle physics (2, A)
10. Cosmology (1, A)

E: essential part
A: advanced part

The exam was separated in 2 parts: E and A. Marks from E part would determine which letter grade you get (A-range, B+, B, B-, C+, ...). Marks from A part would ONLY determine whether you get A+, A or A- if you score high enough in the E part. That means if you fail to get in A-range from the E part, then A part would not do any good.

Midterm: 1-3 + little bit of 4
Final: 4-6, the rest was not covered due to time limitation

Personally I like part 1 special relativity most since he taught a lot in this part and explained everything in details. Other parts are also good but they were not being taught as detailed as special relativity in my opinion.

You would learn a lot by taking this course. It is also a prerequisite to quantum mechanics I course unless you can waive it :)Prof. Wang Yi is one of the best professors I have come across with so far. He explains everything in details and in good logic and this makes it fun to learn modern physics. Apart from that, he also frequently gives out jokes (related to physics, of course) and I would not spoil them here. You will find out that he must be a huge cat lover xd. He is also keen to answer questions raised by students in class, and they were very good questions. Lecture videos were provided if you want to review them.

For TAs, I chose Ming and he was definitely better than the other guy.Course Syllabus:
1. Special Relativity (Essential)
2. General Relativity (Advanced)
3. Action Principle (Advanced)
4. Quantum Mechanics (Essential)
5. Quantum Entanglement (Advanced)
6. Atoms (Essential)
7. Entropy and Information (Advanced)
8. A 30 minutes introduction to cosmology at the very end of this course, but not tested in the exams

Lecture notes are very irritating to read. Those who believe the lecture notes are well made, then they either have not understood the physics or are simply bluffing. In fact, the bad quality of the lecture notes should be more apparent to those who have already learnt the materials. The concepts are introduced in subtle ways, wordings are usually unclear and derivations are often hand-wavy. I understand that theorists in general are not aware of the boundary between "introductory level" and "advanced level", but I cannot agree that the lecture notes are good especially for an introductory class. Students must attend the lectures (or watch the uploaded videos on Canvas) in order to fully understand what the professor was trying to say in the lecture notes. Professor Wang updates his lecture notes every year, so hopefully he will improve his writing for the updated versions.

In addition, most recommended readings at the back of the lecture notes are baffling. For instance, Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Shankar, Modern Quantum Mechanics by Sakurai, Classical Mechanics by Goldstein are definitely not for students who have just started learning sophomore-level physics in an introductory modern physics class. I therefore personally recommend more suitable readings that may be helpful for the beginners to understand the lecture notes (at least minimally, even the list below may not be sufficient sometimes. As I said, the lecture notes are absurd. Some do overlap with what lecture note recommends). These references, including the solution manuals, are readily available online:

<Special Relativity> + <General Relativity>
Introduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths - Chapter 12.1-12.2
A General Relativity Workbook by Brown - just a few beginning chapters correspondent to the contents of the lecture note
Astrophysics Processes by Hale Bradt - chapter 7, beginning sections before relativity in electrodynamics. It has the most elegant proofs I have seen on a textbook so far.

<Action Principle>
Mechanics by Landau, Chapter 1
The Feynman Lectures On Physics, Vol 1, Chapter 26

<Quantum Mechanics>
Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths, Chapter 1-4
Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particles by Elsberg, (if you find even the mathematics in Griffiths is hard, just read through this until you grasp the concept and then go back to Griffiths)

<Entropy and Information>
Concepts in Thermal Physics by Blundell, Chapter 4, Example 4.1 (The example explains the concept of microstates clearly. The definition of microstates is overlooked in the lecture note. Other than this, reading through the lecture note is enough)

Please note to always go back to wrap up the lecture notes as well when you rely on external references, as some problems in the exams were directly from the exercise questions at the back of lecture notes & understanding of the contents on the lecture notes.

For reference, the exercise questions are included as attachments below. These questions were easier than (or maybe somewhat similar to) the actual exams in this semester. However, some exercise questions are poorly designed, irrelevant to the course contents (exercise 6 for instance, was not included in the course syllabus).Professor Wang is enthusiastic about teaching. He always answers questions during the lecture and after the class. He also makes jokes in mandarin to make students engaged. It is hilarious that he is rather shy outside of the class. Although his explanations are not always clear, students can directly ask him for clarification.

The tutorials are taught by the TAs. I chose not to attend the tutorials as I could barely understand the TA's English.Special relativity  
  General relativity  
  From action to laws of nature  
  Quantum mechanics  
  Atoms and molecules  
  Statistical physics  
  Condensed matter
  Complexity  
  Nuclear and particle physics  
  CosmologyThis course is very hilarious. The professor wears different every time and told hilarious jokes. Also the mid term and final questions are quite challenging and new that I have never see some of them elsewhere before. ^_^ He is definitely the best professor I have ever met.This course seems to be a follow-up of PHYS 1314, but NOT PHYS 1114. Many sub-topics for quantum mechanics are taught again. In fact, the only part new is Quantum Entanglement (which is only an advance part).

Simply speaking, the course is mainly about: 1) General and Special Relativity and 2) Quantum Mechanics.

What he actually taught includes:
1. Special relativity (essential)
2. General relativity (advanced)
3. From action to laws of nature (advanced)
-- Mid-term exam --
4. Quantum mechanics (essential)
5. Quantum information (advanced)
6. Atoms and molecules (essential)
7. Statistical physics (essential)
-- Final exam --

For topic (3), it is basically PHYS 3032.
For topic (4), it's PHYS 1314.
For topic (6), it's somehow related to HKDSE's Atomic world elective.He is a nice professor, and always stay behind outside the classroom to answer students' questions. He has also opened a Facebook group too.

I think it's quite good before mid-term. Nevertheless, I don't think he explains the quantum mechanics clearly.Syllabus:
1. *Special relativity (6, essential)
2. General relativity (1, advanced)
3. From action to laws of nature (2, advanced)
4. *Quantum mechanics (5, essential)
5. Atoms and molecules (2, essential)
6. Statistical physics (3, essential)
7. Condensed matter (2, advanced)
8. Complexity (1, advanced)
9. Nuclear and particle physics (2, advanced)
10. Cosmology (1, advanced)

The number indicates the number of lectures planned to cover the topic. Actually only topics 1-6 were covered.The professor is very inspiring and explains things with focus on physical intuition. He does not use slides in class and writes notes on the board. I found this very effective.This course introduces many different and relatively new (20th century) disciplines in physics, with an emphasis on Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Students who are unfamiliar with many of these topics may find this course hard to follow.

The number indicates the number of lectures Prof. Wang will use to cover the topic. If the topic is essential, it counts towards determining your letter grade. If it is advanced, it determines where you are in the A-range. Prof. Wang recommends focusing on the essential content if you find it difficult to revise for all the topics.

Topics 1-3 and the introductory parts of QM were tested on the midterm, while topics 4-6 were tested for the final. "Atoms and molecules" became an "advanced" topic because Prof. Wang wanted to reduce our workload for studying.

Prof. Wang ran out of time to cover topics 7-10, so he only went through them briefly in the final lecture.

My greatest takeaway from this course was from the QM lectures, because they really helped me understand the course content for PHYS3036 more easily.Prof. Wang is a very enthusiastic and organized teacher. Rather than using presentation slides, he writes out all his notes neatly on the whiteboards. His lecture notes follow a logical order, and he occasionally cracks a joke or two to keep his lectures entertaining. He is very open to questions, and answers them well. I want to give him extra points for using cat memes in his presentations for the lab tutorials.

Sometimes he teaches too quickly, and when he skips steps in his explanations, the lectures can become pretty confusing. Otherwise, I really liked his teaching.As an introductory course to more advanced topics, the content in this course is very scattered. Here are the contents:

Action principle (note that we are not supposed to know the calculus of variation at this stage, so this can prove to be a frustrating topic for many)
Special relativity and very brief general relativity
Quantum mechanics (until basic schrödinger's equation, you don't need to know the Mathematical formulation for deeper topics)
Condensed matter physics and thermodynamics (again, very mathematics light)

Overall, even for the most complicated topic (action principle), they are glossed over very briefly, which can be unsatisfactory if one wants to attain a better understanding. This is expected from an introductory course, however.The accent of Prof. Wang is unfortunately quite hard to understand, though not to the degree of confounding my understanding. As a professor lecturing this course for the first time, it is understandable how his teaching is not very clear to beginners. However, as a very devoted professor, he will surely get better as the time goes on.Content was good. It had everything that is required for Higher physics courses. Provided a good introduction to what modern physics is. The focus was on Special relativity and quantum mechanics and there was sufficient mathematical rigour in these topics. Other topics like Condensed Matter, Thermodynamics were qualitatively introduced. Overall, goodThe Professor said this was the first UG course that he taught but surprisingly he was able to teach us quite effectively.This course covers some of the basic Physics concepts that are needed in higher level Physics course. Due to the change in instructor, the contents may be slightly different from the previous years:
Mid-term
-Action Principle (Principle of Extreme Action, symmetry and conservation laws) (1 lesson)
-Special Relativity (5)
-General Relativity (1)
-Quantum Mechanics (2)
Final:
-Quantum mechanics (more details with calculation problems) (3)
-Atoms and molecules (atom orbitals, bonding) (2)
-Condensed matter (Crystal structure, heat capacity, energy band and conductors, semi-conductors) (2)
-Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics (Entropy) (2)
-Complexity (chaos, fractals, complex network) (1)
Not included in exam:
-Nuclear and particle physics (1)
-Cosmology (1)

As you can see, the course includes quite a lot of content--to the point I would say there are too much. Often times there are not enough time to go into details, and the professor may go over some topics too quickly (most students would probably agree on that for the action principle part) that the students may not understand completely.Being Professor Wang's first attempt at teaching an undergraduate course, I would say it is not bad. All of the notes for lecture are hand-written by himself, and he makes an effort to make the topics as interesting as possible, for example, by including jokes and his own drawings. He also encourages students to ask him questions, and even sets up an 'editable version of lecture notes' online, where students can post questions and he can addresses them.The course covers introductory special relativity and quantum mechanics.While Professor Du clearly tries to teach his students, he has trouble expressing himself in a clear and straightforward manner. His lectures on special relativity will leave a lot of his students confused which can be clearly seen from the midterm distribution.

The tutorials were designed to not overlap with the lectures and instead provides supplementary information. While the content itself is interesting, it is not beneficial to students that cannot follow the lectures.I guess it is normal for Physics course but I really need to give it a D because I don't know what the course is about.
The whole content doesn't have any relationship with Phys1114 and I guess you need to preview the knowledge before having the course.
The content before midterm is simpler than after but still, hard work is needed.Professor Du is a Chinese Professor so his English is a bit confusing to me.
And I don't know whether it is the content's fault or the teacher's fault, I just cannot understand what he is talking.
My tutor is a Hong Kong guy but sometimes even he got confused by himself.The content this year is much lesser than last year's content. It emphasizes on Special Relativity & General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Action Principle, Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics, Atoms and Molecules.Professor Wang Yi is passionate in teaching. He is also a very responsible person. He understands the content very well and can answer questions almost immediately. He always welcome questions from students and encourages us to interact more often with him. You can ask him anything, regardless of whether your question is related to the topic, he is very happy to answer them.difficult. very difficult.He teach quite wellFirst, the grading system is quite different with other courses'. As other review mentioned, The content compose of two parts: essential and advanced.

In the midterm examination, I got +2.0 s.d. when counting essential part only and +1.2 s.d. when counting the whole paper.

However, i got both below counting ways below mean in the final examination.

Finally i got an A-.

The grading is very good.

Even if I don't understand any content in the advanced part, i can still got an A-.

However, the essential part doesn't mean that it is easy. The course is not recommended to any student that are not very good at physics. Even if those who are not in the physics major are not recommended.low. very low.Unlike the usual conventional "modern physics" courses, which focus on mainly and only on introductory Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, Prof. Wang had completely redesigned the course syllabus to include a large array of topics, including:

1. Special relativity (6, E)
2. General relativity (1, A)
3. From action to laws of nature (2, A)
4. Quantum mechanics (5, E)
5. Atoms and molecules (2, A)
6. Statistical physics (3, E)
7. Condensed matter (2, A)
8. Complexity (1, A)
9. Nuclear and particle physics (2, A)
10. Cosmology (1, A)

where,
Numbers are approximate number of lectures.
E: Essential material to decide A-range, B-F.
A: Advanced material, helps to distinguish  A+, A, A-.  


Although the SR and QM remained to be the most important part of the course, the course also introduces to the students a variety of topics linked directly to their future studies in physics and gives the student a taste of many more advanced & modern ideas in physics.

This redesigned syllabus has made the course become truly a board introduction to all of modern physics, but not just SR and QM, and in some sense, it even serves as an introduction to the "higher physics".

Unfortunately though, due to time constraint, my class only got to cover everything up to Statistical Physics (with an extra lecture on Cosmology, which was not tested). There are really a lot of topics to be covered in the course and many of them are really difficult (involve quite advanced mathematics), but I did learned a lot from them and I enjoyed the course very much.Excellent. Almost perfect.

Prof. Wang is very passionate about teaching. He always talk with a big smile on his face, and he always try to improve his teaching by asking for feedback from the students. He always try to offer help to the students,. He officially hold an hour of office hour after each lecture to answer questions. You will see a lot of student surround him after each lecture to ask all kind of questions, and he will try to give a satisfactory answer to each of them.

As a physics professor, I think his way of teaching serves as the perfect example of what a college physics course is supposed to be. He wrote his own lecture notes, both typed in LaTeX and drawn on OneNote. Based on these notes, he deliver his lecture using a white board (no more hideous PPT's). He is very knowledgeable about all the contents of the course and even all of physics (and probably not just physics too...), as you can see from the content of the lecture notes, and he has the ability to present and explain his ideas very clearly (Well, at least most of the time). His lecture notes are really beautifully made, both in terms of the writing style, the very clear structure, the developments of physical ideas, the explanation of very physical details, and all the beautifully drawn figure. And all his lecture inherited perfectly all these good things of his lecture notes.

Though, there is still a few small defects in his teaching (that's why I said "almost" perfect):

(1) He tended to assume the students have more mathematical skills & knowledge than they actually have as a 2nd year student, and therefore often didn't give enough explanation on the mathematical details. I would suggest you don't hesitate to ask whenever you don't understand some math - when you don't know something, probably most of the class won't neither, and Prof. Wang will be more than happy to give you the explanation you want.

(2) Prof. Wang doesn't like to give exercises, because he think if you truly understand the physics, then you can apply them to solve the problem right away. I do partially agree with him about this, but unfortunately, this is just too much of an idealization. But on the other hand, because of the uniqueness of this course, it is really hard to find exercise anywhere that fit the scope of it. Hopefully it will get better after a few more runs of this course.


This course is truly amazing and fantastic. And the big idea behind all of this course, is to teach the student to understand and appreciate the beauty of physics and to view it as an art. Honestly, if you find yourself hating this course (well, apart from the grading / exam maybe), it is probably a good sign that physics is not for you. Physics is not about taking exams and calculating things; engineers and DSE students do that.We have covered topics of Action Principle, Special Relativity, General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Atom & Molecule Physics, Condensed Matter, Statistical Physics, Complexity, Nuclear & Particle Physics and Cosmology.
To me the content was really hard but there were still many smart Physics students in the class that could perform outstandingly in this course. I am actually interested in studying Physics but the difficulty seemed to freak me out a little bit.
And I heard that the curriculum of this course was deigned more difficult in this semester than the previous semesters.I am sorry but I could hardly understand his English in class so that was a hindrance for me in studying the course despite the fact that Professor Wang is humble and genuine. And to me, his explanation or interpretation of the concepts or laws are not clear nor easy to grasp.Content is more or less same as the non-honours class PHYS3033. A few extra topics  but everything is from the text book(Introduction to Electrodynamics by Griffiths)I felt that the instructor was better at the honours lecture than the common lecture. Overall, he is a good teacher, will make you understand the connection between conceptsThe content is basically stated as above, it's just a review of PHYS1314, however, we study the laws in differential forms (Divergence theorem version or Stokes theorem version). Professor's Lortz powerpoint can be understood easily, but I suggest you to go through the textbook. Also, be sure to work through the exercises in the textbook, it is a good practice for students and the solutions can be found easily online.Professor Lortz is a very caring person, if you encounter any difficulties, just talk to him. He always welcome questions from students. One thing I partly disagree with him is that, to me, I prefer him to teach this course using marker pen rather than powerpoint, like during the honor's tutorial, which I enjoyed it very much. The lectures during the honor's tutorial are of the appropriate standard. However, those that involve horrible Math would not be tested as promised, but I suggest you to go through them too.This course is to let you do experiments on the topics that you have learnt in PHYS1112. The lab report will not be so difficult as there are many sources out there. Simply Google it.There will be a briefing session at the very beginning of the lab session. They may give you some tips during this session.Everyone feels like Albert Einstein in this course, believing they have disproved some of the fundamental laws of classical mechanics. The only problem is----this is a lab course for classical mechanics, not modern physics.
There is simply too much emphasis on the propagation of random errors but not a single f*ck was given to systematic errors. [eg. Students are not asked to keep only the data that made sense so full credit was given to students who got 30-50% percentage error. But if you miss the +/-0.01g error of measuring things using the accursed electronic balance (which only accounts to ~0.001% of the error), your lab report marks will be below mean. Isn't it fascinating?]
Anyways, this lab is still a good way to help you develop practical skills, which will definitely help you handle everyday appliances, or perhaps... realizing your not-so-distant dreams of becoming a Nobel-bearing scientist.Dr. Su is nice and is always willing to give advice to those in need, be it at tutorials or practical sessions. However, some of her marking rubrics are quite ridiculous.
And don't get me started on the TAs...useful knowledge to let you understand the practical nature of physics, especially in making measurement and taking error, so a B is given in this criterialittle guidance is given, just enough for you to finish your workgrade is ok, acceptable, quite very reasonable, fair, so a B is given for this criteriathe workload is totally not acceptable
as a 1-cred course, the workload is even more than other 3/4 cred courses. make sure u have enough time to finish the god damn lab report.
It should have been a 3-cred courseThis course is designed to complement with the standard year 1 physics course (PHYS11112/PHYS1312), covering experiments about some of the topics taught in these courses.
The course includes 10 experiments:
M1 The Atwood Machine
M2 Projectile Motion
M3 Centripetal Force
M4 Work, Energy and Friction
M5 Conservation of Linear Momentum
M6 Rotational Motion
M7 Conservation of Angular Momentum
M8 Simple Harmonic Motion
M9 Standing Waves on a Vibrating String
H1 Specific Heat and Latent Heat of VaporizationFor the tutorial session, Dr. Su's teaching is quite average. In fact, since the powerpoints are available in the course website anyway, it is possible to just not attend the tutorials and be fine, since nothing interesting happens in the tutorial anyways (assuming there is one that week)
As for the lab itself, there really isn't much in the way of teaching. If you want to talk about the technicians, they are quite willing to help. As for the TAs, I wish they could just stop deducting so many marks for the numerical error part--you can lose so many marks there it is not even funny.Involves a total of ten experiments, 9 about mechanics and 1 for heat.
The topics are:
1. Atwood Machine
2. Projectile Motion
3. Centripetal Force
4. Work, Energy and Friction
5. Conservation of Linear Momentum
6. Rotational Motion
7. Conservation of Angular Momentum
8. Simple Harmonic Motion
9. Standing Waves on a Vibrating String
And
10. Specific Heat and Latent Heat of Vaporization

In general , the experiments are not too difficult, except for some experiments where the apparatus are in extremely poor condition and you may not be able to obtain expected results. (e.g. You probably won't obtain a conserved linear momentum result EVEN in ELASTIC COLLISION)

Taking attendance is required.Professor Su is very kind and very willing to answer any questions with regard to the experiments.

There will be different TAs for each laboratory session, some of them are good, while some not. It depends on pure luck.The course conducts experiments relevant to the PHYS 1111/1112 course. The list is listed in other comments thus I will skip it.
More than the experiments itself, this course also emphasizes on experimental errors.
Some said that the course should emphasize on also experimental methods.
No final exams or midterms.
Attending tutorials is not necessary every week, only in the specified weeks.
Attendance in tutorials and lab sessions will be recorded.In my opinion, she is a good teacher.
At the last session of tutorial, we were allowed to give advices and raise questions relevant to the course.10 Experiments
1. Atwood Machine
2. Projectile Motion
3. Centripetal Force
4. Work, Energy and Friction
5. Conservation of Linear Momentum
6. Rotational Motion
7. Conservation of Angular Momentum
8. Simple Harmonic Motion
9. Standing Waves on a Vibrating String
And
10. Specific Heat and Latent Heat of VaporizationThe course consists of 10 experiments. Each experiment has 3 parts: pre-lab questions, experimental data, and lab analysis.
The experiments are on:
1. Atwood Machine
2. Projectile Motion
3. Centripetal Force
4. Work, Energy and Friction
5. Conservation of Linear Momentum
6. Rotational Motion
7. Conservation of Angular Momentum
8. Simple Harmonic Motion
9. Standing Waves on a Vibrating String
And
10. Specific Heat and Latent Heat of VaporizationProf Yumian Su is very helpful and willing to answer any questions that you might have.PHYS1113 mainly focus on mechanics experiments which are also the syllabus of PHYS1112. 9/10 are mechanics experiments while the last one is about heat. Most of them are pretty easy to understand and has no difficulty to obtain accurate data. However, a good partner is really important, otherwise you may lag behind the schedule. It could enhance your understanding in PHYS1112 knowledge.Dr. Su is a really nice tutor. She is willing to answer you any questions and sometimes may even help you to set up your equipments. However, her tutorial is quiet boring but you better go to the tutorial because she will warn you to avoid some minor mistakes.

The other factor is TA, they will grade your lab performance and lab report. Well. I could say this depends on your luck.

Technicians are very nice and amusing. As all of them are HongKongers, you could ask for help in Cantonese.The content consist of 10 experiments revolving 9 Force and Mechanics labs and a heat lab. It provides an excellent opportunity to put the theories you learnt in PHYS1112 into practical use.The teaching is quite good, but you won't learn much unless you approach Dr. Su after class or during lab session , She is very kind and willing to explain the notes comprehensively.Content is related to PHYS1112 and it is quite useful to understand more on PHYS1112The instructor is very willing to give advice and opinions on how to do better in the lab report and give help when you face any difficulties during the experiment.If you do the experiment seriously, the lab performance will not be bad and it will stick to the mean.Workload is more than other courses. There is one lab report per week and it is quite hard to finish in the beginning, but it will be better when you are familiar with the lab report.A bit difficult in the last part of the course. Especially on relatively, will be a bit difficult to understand without science background.Got interaction with students and make jokes. Make the topic more interesting by showing movie clips by related to sciences.Good! More than 20% of people get A range which is much more than the university regulation and would be good grade. I know a case that below 0.5 S.D. in final still got a B.The main workload will be on the bi-week quiz but no homework and assignment. Just focus on the quiz is ok and it could open book, mainly test on understanding on topic and calculation. Final mainly calculation in Long question. Quiz and exam just test on basic and easy and simple.Note that the syllabus is changed this year. In a nutshell, the mathematical stuff is no longer required, but there will be more technical stuff contextually detailed.

The course contents are separately taught by four professors, mainly Ng Yee Fai and Lin Nian. To be personal, the syllabus is broad, but without systematic organization. (And I think many things in this course are not Year-1 level at all. Although the professors are just attempting to give a brief account on those things, they are still hard to comprehend.)

Here is basically what we have to learn in each chapter. The level of difficulty of each chapter (from my point of view) for a physics beginner is also indicated.

Ng Yee Fai part:
1. Energy
- Mechanical Energy (Potential Energy, Kinetic Energy, Work-Energy Theorem)
- Conservation of Energy
- Sources of Energy (Solar, Wind, Tidal, Geothermal, Hydrogen, Plasma)
- Nuclear Power (Fission, Fusion, Nuclear Reactors, Mass-Energy Equivalence)

This chapter is a bit difficult when it comes to plasma and nuclear power, which constitute around half of the chapter.

2. Daily Applications (A)
- Thermodynamics
Application 1: Heat Engine (e.g. Internal Combustion Engine)
Application 2: Heat Pumps (e.g. Refrigerator and Air-con)

- Electromagnetism
。Electric charge (Applications: Photocopiers, laser printers, 3d printers)
。Capacitors (Applications: RAM, Touch Screens, Supercapacitor bus)
。Electromagnetic Induction (Applications: Transformers, Inductive Charging, Electric Guitar, Motors, Generators, Hybrid Automobiles, Maglev)

As a physics beginner, I took several days to at least understand what all the text in the slides of this chapter is talking about. Not easy at all.

3. Daily Applications (B)
- Mechanics
。Acceleration (Application: MEMS)
。Oscillation (Application: Electronic Clocks)

- Optics
。Polarization (Application: 3D-Viewing, LCD)

- Modern Physics
。Photoelectric effect (Application: CCD)
。Molecules and Condensed Matters (Application: LED, OLED)
。Atoms
    1. Laser (Application: Holography)
    2. Atomic clocks (Application: GPS)

Same as the previous chapter, I took many efforts to understand what the fuck is going on.

4. Medical Applications
- Waves
。Sound waves (Application: Ultrasound Imaging)

- Optics
。Fiber optics (Application: Endoscopy)

- Modern Physics
。Laser (Application: LASIK, PRK)
。X-ray (Application: X-ray Imaging, CAT)
。Pair Annihilation (Application: PET)
。NMR (Application: MRI)

As time passed by, the chapters of Ng Yee Fai part became easier. For this chapter, X-ray, pair annihilation and NMR are the more difficult parts, comprising a large portion of the chapter. But at least, way easier to understand compared to daily applications!

5. Disasters
- Stellar Impact (e.g. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, the Cretaceous extinction, The Chelyabinsk Asteroid, The Yunnan Fireball, A/2017 U1)

- Earthquake (Seismic waves, Earth's internal layers, earthquake causes, magnitude scales)

- Nuclear weapons
。Atomic bombs (Little Boy, The Gadget, Fat Man)
。Hydrogen Bomb (Fusion Bomb)
。Aftermath of nuclear explosions

- Nuclear Reactor Accidents (The Three Mile Island Accident, The Chernobyl Accident, The Fukushima Accident)

Largely related to the chapter of Energy (the first chapter listed). The earthquake and nuclear weapon parts are relatively difficult, composing a large part of this chapter.

6. Environmental Issues
a. Solar Radiation
b. Greenhouse Effect
c. The Keeling Curve
d. Global Warming
e. Carbon footprint

The easiest chapter, throughout the WHOLE COURSE, because they are mainly senior level Geography stuff, with less details.

Each chapter has a slide of around 80-100 pages. Some of the pages are just video, pictures and demonstrations, but most of them will be wordy contextual details.

Lin Nian part:
1. Introduction
Shit intro.

2. New Material and Physics

Current Materials
- Silicon
(Application: PN-junction diode, PNP-junction transistor)
- Carbon (Graphite and Graphene)
(Application: Flexible display, graphene nanoribbons, carbon nanotube)

- Quantum materials (Quantum hall effect)

Supplement: Superconductors

3. Microscopy and Nanotechnology

Microscopy
- History
- Properties of light (EM wave, diffraction)

Quantum gravity, particle masses, quantum measurement, turbulence, dark energy, dark matter, complexity, matter-antimatter asymmetry, friction, arrow of time

Just some brief introduction to the above unsolved problems and ending of the course.

I had many question marks on my head whenever I took a seat in Lin Nian's lecture. I could not even understand his notes. Of course they are more concise than Ng Yee Fai's, but the notes gave no explanation (just some random combinations of description, pictures and mathematical equations).

"Ahhhhhh..... Mathematics is intrinsically fucking beautiful......"

====GUEST LECTURES====

Liu Tao: Elementary Particles and Standard Model
?????????????????????????????????????????????

Wang Yi: Universe and Cosmology
I can say I know what is going on, but I cannot say so either.......

Two documentaries:
- The Big Bang Machine
- Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking

Long documentaries. I think I do not really love physics (or science). I found the documentaries uninteresting, but sure, way more understandable than the NOTES of the guest lectures.I don't know why, but I just couldn't help sleeping in the lectures. The lectures, objectively speaking, are not really boring. Yeah, I still fell asleep during the lectures, very often.

I also found myself unable to follow what the professors were teaching. But for Ng Yee Fai, I could still drop down some notes and then try to understand afterwards. While for Lin Nian, well, I couldn't find any main points from his speaking.

(Oh, I coincidentally discovered that Lin Nian is / was in charge of PHYS 1314 and the course reviews there have more comments about him, the first two of which are indeed accurate..)

Tutorial: Ng Ka Long
Pure wastage of time. But you still have to attend the tutorial, because it counts towards your final grade. I should have swapped to other sessions.Very basic, as long as you have some background in physics, there shouldnt be any difficulty at all.The professor speaks good English and its easy to understand. He talks a lot about additional information which does not appear on the exam. Didnt attend many lectures.No work load,this is the most attracting point of this courseBasic physics stuff and no calculation were needed.As a student who have no high school physics knowledge, I didnt quite understand the content.For this semester, 30% tutorial attendance 70% final in MC format.
I failed in junior high school physics and still got a B, only studied about 2 days before the final, attended all tutorial sessions.Small. No need to attend all the lecture and all exam content were supposed to be in power point content. Tutorial classes were quite useless and all about finishing few MC question in class for attendance. Quite a waste of time from my opinion.You will learn some fundamental physics law and theories.
There are topics involving,Quantum Physics, The Universe and Relativity in the last couple of weeks. However examination and quizzes are mostly related to executing their formulas provided on lecture notes. So no worry.

Students studying engineering and science without taking phyiscs in HKDSE must take this course in order to take PHYS1112.Lectures are quite boring.
Interesting experiments will be performed after lectures.Basic Physics knowledge, if you drop physics for the DSE syllabus, it will be very easy for you to pick up. For those who studied chemistry before also take advantage in this course.Monotone, but sometimes funny when playing video and his act. Somehow he is cute in his age.Every detail has to remember. Each lecture note has 80-100 pages around. There are also guest lectures and documentaries. Everything is included in the exam.

The worst are the guest lectures and documentaries.  Don't know what they are talking about.Good Grade, only final exam.
30% tutorial attendance
70% FinalThe content of the course is listed below.

-Energy and Power
- Atoms and heat
-Force and Gravity

Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to
--- appreciate the wonders of physics and its power to understand the mechanism of the Universe: from the microscopic world to the macroscopic world;
--- develop literacy in the physical and technological innovations of the modern society;
--- recognize the empirical, theoretical, and philosophical foundation of physics, and to think scientific and critical in terms of the language of physics;
--- employ the knowledge of physics to explain some daily-life physical phenomena, and to solve simple physics-related problems;
---establish and realize the connection of physics with other scientific disciplines, technology, inventions, and the society;
be aware of the impact of physics on the society, ethics, economy, and the environment, and to cultivate an attitude of being a responsible citizen.The teaching is quite good. The professor explains every concepts clearly and sometimes, in a funny way. It might be hard to follow somehow, but reviewing the lecture notes and attending the tutorials every week would definitely help. There are 4 documentary videos in the whole course and students are expected to watch the videos in order to gain marks for iprs. (have to answer questions through iprs which counts 10% of your final grade)This course has a wide range of content about Physics. From the classical physics and even quantum physics. It takes time to digest and understand all the content. But the note may include some online video and it helps a lot for me to get the full picture of it and also arouses my interest about physics. to be honest the final exam is extremely easy. you may not know how everything works but recite the content.Dr Ng is funny and patient to teach every single concept. his english is good and you may not get lost during the lesson. but prof Lin may have some accent but still ok. both of them will demonstrate some experiment in the lecture. it is quite fun. there are some guest speakers in some lectures talking about some advanced physics but i skipped those lessons so  im not sure about that. and the last few lectures there are no more lectures but a documentary. prof played the documentary in the lessons and the content of it is also examined. but this makes the lectures more interesting.No assignments or projects at all, the material is interesting and introduces a lot of up to date technology discoveries. Lectures do not check attendance but tutorials do.The professor is a passionate and humorous person, is really good at explaining concepts (sometimes even through experiments in lectures). However the Instructional Assistant‘s(NG, Ka Long) tutorials  does not introduce any new knowledge. He only answers a few multiple choice question in class and that's all. He shows no teaching passion and is extremely rude.A lot of topics but without calculation and very little about physics theoryBoring, esp LIN Nian's lecture30% Tutorial attendance, attendance can be taken by the others, quite a lot of people do so.

70% Final Examination, about half questions are taken out from the tutorial multiple choice questions

Only grade, without marks of both partsLectures are not compulsory but the tutorial is required.

Just recite the tutorial mc and the large words in the lecture notes and have a brief concept

Take less than three hours to do revision before final exam1

Prof. LIN, NianDont really understand what the lecturer is talking about .The content is in huge amount and extremely difficult such as relativity.
Topics include energy and power, atom and heat, force and gravity, nuclear power, electricity and magnetism, waves, light, quantum physics, the universe and relativity.Teaching is not good because the content is very rich, so the concepts are not clearly explained in the lecture. For tutorial, the teaching quality is slightly better and we will know the main point of the quiz or exam. Tutorial is of paramount importance, so full attendance is a must.
There will be some online exercise on canvas but do not count for any marks.
One past paper will be uploaded on canvas for you to practice but the level of the practice paper and the actual final exam paper is extremely different.
Additional 2 exercises will also be provided before the final exam.It's a course which introduces all the physics topics in a simple manner. Starting from energy, forces to wave and light and even quantum physics and relativity. The topics after quantum physics are a bit hard for understanding. But others are as simple as junior secondary school science. You do not even need to think and you can obtain full mark in the quizzes.

There will also be some documentary to arouse your interest in physics, which is quite entertaining. You may sleep if you find it bored. PRS questions will be asked after each documentaries. Just see the others' answers if you slept.Prof. NG is an excellent professor in teaching physics. He can stimulate your thinking and provoke your interest in studying the topics. Although he has monotonic voice, you can find the interesting parts if you keep your brain running in the lesson.This course teaches you the basic knowledge of Physics in dse syllabus, like: Energy and Power
Atoms and Heat
Force and Gravity
Nuclear Power
Electricity and Magnetism
Waves
Light
Quantum Physics
The Universe
Relativitythe professor teaches very well and explains clearly. He also does experiments and make funny video clips besides reading out the powerpoint. You are always welcomed to ask him questions about the topics and he would be very pleased to answer you with patience.Easy for understanding
all the things are based on the HKDSE physics complusory part
No need to worry the content is too hardBad presentation. His voice is very very soft and he wont have any interactions with the others. Just like a electronic dictionary reading the materialsMean could be B- to B.
It consists of two quizzes, a final exam and four iprs movie classVery low. Only two quiz and a final exam. No midterm exam.
There are no homework. Only need to attend four movie class for iprs marks.The syllabus covers a lot, it might be difficult for students without any physics background. But for people who are interested or good at physics, the course is worth to take.The professor was trying to deepen our understanding of physics by giving a lot of examples/ applications, but for me, it's quite boring. But attending tutorials could help you understand more clearly.10 topics:
Energy and power
Atoms and heat
Force and gravity
Nuclear power
Electricity and Magnetism
Waves
Light
Quantum physics
The universe
RelativityProfessor is very nice and his lessons are quite interesting.
TA will simplify the contents and explain again in the tutorial classes.This course includes basic knowledge of Physics in high school.The professor is patient. He shows many experiment to prove the theories during lesson. Also, the pace of his teaching is acceptable. Each topic will be finished within 2 lectures.
If you can't follow the lecture, just go to tutorial. TA will explain the topic again. They are willing to answer questions.Cover the syllabus of DSE physics. Though it seems to be a lot, the content is shallow. It can be followed even for a non-science major student.Teaching materials are well-prepared. The professor tries to make the lecture more intriguing by linking the theory to.real life example.Cheat sheets are allowed for both quizzes and exam which make them a lot easier. As long as the cheat sheets is well-prepared and the concepts are well-understood, geeting A range is just a piece of cake.No homework. Only two quizzes and a final. iPRS is needed for specific lectures, wether to attend the rest of the lectures is up to peraonal choice.phys1001 is not difficult, you will get a good grade if you are willing to spend on it. Well suggusted to register in all semesters, especially fall semester.the professor teach very well, he explain everything very clearly makes every students understand the content. Even if you dont attend lesson, you can still study all the notes and get a good grade.The curriculum will be amended next semestergood
probably the best science course professors i have met so farextremely good
Quiz 1: full marks
Quiz 2: above mean 1 SD
Final: above mean 2 SD
I got an A+ at the end
even students without physics background can get a good grade
but better with science background (like some basic knowledge on Chemistry)no assignment
only 2 quizzes, 4 iprs and final
The quizzes are not difficult
The final questions are a bit tricky and required you to understand how to use the formula instead of substituting all numbers into that formulaTopics:
Energy and Power
Atoms and Heat
Force and Gravity
Nuclear Power
Electricity and Magnetism
Waves
Light
Quantum Physics
The Universe
Relativity

Also included 4 documentary, which is watching movies about Force and Gravity, Quantum Physics, the Universe and Relativity. Then answer several PRS questions.Prof. teaches clearly. Sometimes there is experiment demonstrated.
Tutorial (TA: Jerry):  He helps us to revise some important concept. He also explains clearly.
I think it is important to go to tutorial, especially for the last 3 topics, which is more difficult.there are:
- 20 chapter of basic phys which is about light, wave, relativity,quantum mech, etc
you can bring 1 cheat sheet (both sides) to the quiz so it can easily handle the quizFai Fai is good teacher and he is funny
You can ask him question and he is willing to answer all of them and he is nice as well.
He tried his best to teach
but if you want good grade for the quiz, you need to find someone to carry lolit says it is an introductory course, but it is very hard to manage. There are 22 lecture around 1x topics, all HKDSE physic topics has to be covered in one semester. Quite challenging to be understand everything in such a short period of time. More importantly if you are not a big fan of science, don't reg this course just because people say it's quite simple ( it really depends)Teaching is alright, in LTA, the professor reads the powerpoint slides. However, the professors tries to make it entertaining he does experiments and plays funny videos.light workload. only a few quizzes which is open-note and it is easy if you revise.
Four IPRS and will send you emails before iprsEnergy and Power
Atoms and Heat
Force and Gravity
Nuclear Power
Electricity and Magnetism
Waves
Light
Quantum Physics
The Universe
RelativityFundamental Physics knowledge. Topics include energy and power, force and gravity, electricity and magnetism, quantum physics and relativity. Topics before the first quiz are easy to handle. But contents starting from the second quiz become more challenging, especially quantum physics and relativity.Teaching is interesting and it definitely helps if you listen to the instructor's explanation because some of the topics are abstract.Interesting course cover classical and modern physics from basic topics such as heat and energy, force and gravity and nuclear energy
to E&M, wave, light, quantum physics, universe and relativity.

Very brief in each topics (2~4 lectures) with basic concepts/ formulas. Quiet easy in the first half of the course second half need some time to understand.

End of some lecture will have demonstration. 4 documentaries with PRS questions weighed 10% of final grading.Interesting. Switching between short video clips and powerpoint to clarify or explain some concepts.

Tutorial will do deeper in some concepts, but no necessary to attend except days of quizzes.The content of the course is literally introductory and very easy to be understood, even for beginners. Also, the quizzes replacing the mid-term exam are less pressurized.The tone of the lecture is quite slow and steady. Furthermore, at the end of lectures, there is a small practical session for all of us to enjoy and experience the nature of physics in a simple way.The content is quite ''comprehensive'' indeed as many topics like quantum phys, the universe, light, nuclear power........  Given the large number of topics, that means he can only talked a little bit on each topic so the content would not be in depth, he taught energy and power in only 2 lectures, which was too few for DSE physics according to my friends.

I really have not studied phys in my high school (so ppl who have studied but dropped would have an edge :(((((((( but I find the content still manageable (or just manageable)Fai Fai was very nice and willing to answer students' questions :) He had lots of video which helped me learn and interesting as well.It's about some basic physics content and it's very suitable for students that did not study physics before.
This course is for students with no physics background.

No. of Credits: 3

Outlook of contemporary physicsBoth lecture and tutorial is good because they explain the concept clearly.And the documentary session during the lecture can help student have better understanding of the content.The depth of the course is basically equivalent to that of senior high school-or-so in Mainland China. (With exception that the cosmology part is a bit deeper, but it won't be a problem.) In this course, calculation and math is NOT the emphasis. Numbers will be made simple so you don't use all your time doing math. They want to induce interest for physics in students from outside SCIE department. So enjoy~Voice is loud and clear (with speaker of course), yet a little soft. Quite a lot of fun experiments and documentaries are used, adding some spices into the course. The instructor and his TA surely do put a lot of effort in it. So, be respectful. If you wanna sleep, OK, but plz don't snore.This course is really about the basic physics, taught in the high school. No calculations needed, just theoretical knowledge.The professor tries to make his subject as interesting as possible, but his speech is very monotonic, so it is pretty hard to withstand the whole lecture without sleeping.Grading is not bad as in the Math courses, but usually the mean is about 65-70 on each exam. Moreover, you have to attend the lectures to get another 15% for PRS.Easy workload. No assignments, no homework, just two exams. I would suggest just to revise the material after each lecture and it should be fine.Too easy for student at college level. Wishing for more advanced materials.A very patient teacher. Gentle and funny. Well-prepared and organized ppt. Interactive teaching with lots of documentaries and demonstrations (Personally I wish that Einstein documentary could be less personal and more academic.) It's always so good to support the theory with instant demos. Great job!

Some TA's English is a bit difficult to follow. But they are actually very eligible ones. You could probably benefit a lot if you ask them questions. :)Dse physics content which are quite difficult starting from EM.

Some students who dropped physics in dse can take the course. They must have known more.

Last few chapters are about universe and relativity, I found that must more interesting than the previous ones.Fai fai teaching is fair, he tries to make the lecture more interesting by doing some experiments and making jokes. Well, the general atmosphere is still boring. He speaks very very slow so there would not be difficulties in understanding. One point that I don't like is that he always uses some advanced words which we may not understand. More clarification should be better. Overall, his teaching is satisfactory.

For the tutorial, Jerry reintroduced the concepts from the very beginning, so it is easier for us beginners to learn. But remember to sit in the front or you can see nothing. His words are tiny.The course syllabus is the second half of the Griffiths' book (Introduction to electrodynamics). Homework and some exam questions were taken from this book so I would recommend doing all exercises if you want to get good grades.The teaching is fair. He sometimes carried away from the main topic to discuss off-topic applications but went back quickly. The pace is a bit on the slower side, his English accent is OK and easy to understand.The content covers the latter half of Griffiths, including

1. electromagnetic energy and momentum
2. electromagnetic wave
3. potentials (gauge transform, Lorentz gauge and retarded potential)
4. radiation of dipole, accelerating point charge, etc.
5. electrodynamics and relativity

All of them (except 4 probably) are essential in the picture of classical electrodynamics.

Prof. Zhang also attempts to provide more details that the textbook lacks (e.g. the derivation of retarded potential using Green function) if he thinks this is useful.Prof. Zhang is a well-intentioned teacher who likes to emphasize on the conceptual side of physics. How he often provides additional materials and alternative derivations for the results in the textbook are proofs of that.

Unfortunately, he speaks in a low voice and stammers a lot, which makes it straining to follow his teaching. Moreover, he is not so familiar with the use of software (perhaps a result of his old age), which has caused quite a bit of hiccups.The experiments covered in this course are rather modern and are well designed. Some aspects that may be overlooked during theoretical examination are carefully brought out in this course as part of the general observations.Prof. Lortz provides a very clear structure in his presentations before the experiment. This enables one to watch out for technical details. The basic principles behind every experiment are not compiled in any one book which makes the presentations very informative and useful to attend. Another useful tip is to ask Tony (the IA) whenever you are stuck, he has all the answers and is extremely competent.Griffth's Introduction to Quantum Mechanics(2nd/3rd edition) ch1-ch5.2(up until Hund's rule).
You must know calculus, linear algebra and ODE to study this course(PDE is optional).Prof. CHAN loved to write everything on the whiteboard. Although we  have lecture notes alongside, it was difficult to follow especially when you need to sit at the side of classroom(why dun he write on a paper and project it to the screen??). And I think his tone was quite boring that you could easily fall sleep. However, the notes are quite clear and you could ask him the ans. of the blank after class if you miss it.Lecture Schedule:

No extra content is taught, neither is the homework any harder, its just that you are sitting in class with a bunch of extremely smart people, and the exams questions are tougher.

The homework before the midterm was any 6 questions from the back of the textbook (3 Qs from the chapter taught in class, 3 from the chapter which will be taught in class next week)
After the midterm, this was changed to 12 questions due to a midterm disaster.
The homework doesn't prepare you for the midterm or finals. ThisWith all due respect, Professor Lin doesn't know a thing about teaching.

He has a poorly made set of PowerPoint presentations, the versions of those presentations available on the course website are outdated and are missing important parts.

He attempts to use a self-learning methodology to teach us, which is another way of saying he wants us to do everything, while he gets to sit back and relax. In the class he glides over the surface of the topics, without discussing them in depth. His emphatic voice modulation gives him the impression that he is imparting some life-changing knowledge, instead he is simply reading the slides verbatim.

In class, he gives students in-class exercises (these are graded and are meant to be solved in groups of 3/4). After giving a certain exercise, he doesn't bother solving it himself. In total, he didn't solve more than 3-4 exercises out of a total of 60-70 of them. Even if he sees someone being unable to solve one, he wouldn't bother doing anything about it.

He has a habit of rushing and skipping through important parts of the course, which is understandable since the content covered is vast and he gets just 3 classes a week. But what is not understandable is the fact that on certain occasions he spends half the lecture discussing the personal lives of dead scientists instead of teaching us important concepts, or solving problems with us.

On top if all this, we can't miss the lectures because of the graded in class exercises.

He didn't responded to any of the 3 emails I wrote to him (I finally had to go to his office to get him to talk).
In contrast, the TA was much more helpful and responsive.

Phys 1312 was a much better course, and Professor Chan was infinitely better than Professor Lin. If you are expecting a course as enjoyable as Phys 1312, consider this a warning.Just like PHYS1312, this course covered a lot of topic in an extremely fast pace, including basic electromagnetism, optics (but of course in more depth, I suppose, than the usual PHYS1114) and some elementary quantum mechanics out of nowhere.

The quantum mechanics part will take the whole last two or three weeks of the course to cover, as a result AC circuit will be excluded from the topic list and the optics part will be taught at an even faster rate.

The content is not too bad. I actually like the idea of including a brief introduction to QM as an epilogue. But it is the way that Prof. Lin handled it, or in other words, the overall course design make everything look bad (more on that in "teaching").In my opinion, Prof. Lin really have some thoughts on the physics education , and do really trying the best to teach physics in the "right way". But it is just that he never actually achieving what he want the course to be.

(1) He expect the students to do much of the learning by themselves, and expect the lecture (btw, the tutorial is used as an extra lecture as well) to be more like a "discussion session".

But in spite of that, in the lecture most of the time he just read aloud the very poorly-made PPT that more or less the same as the text book. (btw, I feel strange that why both of the "honors" introductory physics course rely so much on PPT for teaching, this is by far the worst way to teach physics and I seriously didn't expect this to been seen in an "honors course".)

He did add a discussion component to the lecture by occasionally asking the students to work out some "discussion questions" in groups and share their answers among each others. But this work fairly poorly, at least for me. Firstly, most of these so-called "discussion questions" are just some "simple calculations", according to Prof. Lin,  so it is either you get it right or wrong and there is really not much point of discussing. Second, although seldom there may be some exception, but most of these "simple calculations" are not anything that particularly inspiring in terms of helping you to think about the physics, and Prof. Lin won't even give out the correct answer to the class; I am no genius, so how the hell do I learn from these "open-end" yet "right-or-wrong" questions? Thirdly, although I myself am not a genius, but there are plenty of those really smart people siting around you, and from time to time I feel very pressured by how fast they can come up with the solution. I think competition is not really an element that Prof. Lin intended to put in the class, but he just accidentally did, and I feel bad about it. Finally, all these "discussion questions" count toward your grade (you need to submit your paper after each lecture), so this in effect make the lecture mandatory even though attending it may not be much of benefit.

(2) I must emphasis once again, the PPT used in the lecture are very very poorly-made. The structure and layout are really messy, the figures are quite hard to read and not to mention that equations always look hideous in PPT. It is really unpleasant to read through the PPT and it is  never a good idea to use them to review nor to even study the material for the first time.

(3) The homework is another attempt of Prof. Lin of creating the "self-engaging" atmosphere. Every week you can choose freely from the textbook 3+3 problem to work out, 3 for the chapter the class currently on and 3 for the next chapter after you have pre-study it.

This sounds quite good in theory but it doesn't work in practice. Firstly, the textbook chosen is again one of those commercial-kind of textbook that is not really suitable to a "honors physics course" which expects the students to obtain a very deep understanding of physics. Second, the homework completely fail to prepare you for the exams. The midterm, as many had already said, is just a disaster. None of the textbook problems, in my opinion, is comparable to the difficulty of the examination (simply because the textbook does not fit). And you can't really expect anything on the exam, because the Prof. didn't give you any chance to. To be honest, the exam is not really that difficult, but it just requires you to have a level of understand that one can't obtain just by simply doing the homework and attending the lecture.

(4) Well, but the good thing is at least Prof. Lin is very willing to answer questions from students and have a very good attitude toward the students.It's about general physics, with the content almost the same as PHYS1114. However, this course concentrate more on the proving of some well-known theories and have more calculation.Professor's CHENGLISH is quite attractive but may be difficult for international students to understand sometimes. His teaching materials are sufficient, though. He also loves to solve the students' problem and confusion.The course is essentially a rehash of PHYS 1413. It covers all of the content taught in 1114 except for AC circuits and geometric optics and also covers some introductory quantum mechanics.Professor Lin has set up the course to be more of a self study course. He expects all of the students to study the lecture materials before attending class and spends most of the lecture glossing through the notes and raising thought provoking questions. While his teaching method may increase one's interest in EM, students who lack the motivation to self study will perform poorly in class.The content is basically similar as PHYS 1114 except that Professor Lin Nian included some fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics. Alternating current circuits is not required. For quantum mechanics, he does not require us to fully understand the concept but he wanted us to know how to solve the Schrondinger Equation(basically it is solving the second order differential equation). So, you need some math here and the exam questions on quantum mechanics is just solving equations and drawing a graph (its all math). So, that is not much to worry about although the concept on quantum mechanics is quite hardI think Professor Lin Nian is a very good professor. He did not spoon feed students. He gave us some hints to solve a problem and would expect us to work it out ourselves. We can ask him again if we do not know how to solve it. If you have any questions, just ask him directly, don't hesitate about it. He is very approachable and friendly. He is always in his office (I can find him every time)Very very fast. You can't follow the lectures if u didn't have science background.

Especially King Chow's lectures. He's fucking CRAAAAZZZZZZZZY!!!!!!!!!!

DUN TAKE THIS COURSE IF U DIDN'T KNOW SCIENCE!!!Content was very interesting, especially the LIFS and the PHYS module. However, I feel so pointless learning all these "interesting" information. Math was just horrible. There were mistake in every 5 slides in his pptFor YAN, Min, he is pretty http://horrible.So many mistakes and he doesn't know how to explain.Lots of HISTORY and HISTORY.For the Maths part, I totally didn't understand what Prof. Min trying to express. And he made lots of mistake in his notes and kept saying sorry for making mistakes on this slides again and again. He just told us to search on Internet for more and he just searched on the Internet to make these notes. Mid-term scores were released in the final exam period and with no mean scores and standard deviations.The course involved too much in-depth knowledge and is not really designed for students with no science background.Fair. Kind of boring though. Skip lessons if you want to.Not sure as the grade is not released. Won't recommend it if you are not confident enough in science sector, as you will find it extremely difficult to catch up the class.No individual assignments. You have to work as a team to create a poster for a certain science-related topic and present to the professor at the end of the semester.Content is suitable for non-science students.
I initially came to learn physics in this fast-track course. Cramming the physics theories and explaining them accurately closed-book in 3 weeks are absolutely hard though.
And the difficulty is not for non-science students who didn't excel in science subjects!YAN: so many uh...uh...uhs, but explains the math concepts clearly, just that you need time to digest ancient maths.
WILLAMS: takes iPRS for additional points to your chem exam. Average teaching.
FOREMAN: teaches a lot of informative stuff in physics. If you are a student with little/no prior phys knowledge, I suggest you read and try to understand the slides before lectures coz there's a hell lot of crappy formulae to memorise.
CHOW: such a lively biology prof. Uses the surroundings to explain some biology concepts (e.g. genetic drift from smarter students to students who like to fall asleep in class). Conceptualisation is much more important than rote reciting.Need to learn for all PHY, CHEM, MATH, and LIFS module. Mid term is the PHY and MATH module exam while final is the CHEM and LIFS module exam. All of them share the same amount 20% each, along with the presentation and poster that includes the other 20%.It's really boring to attend to class since the professors just read from the powerpoint slides and there are a lot of content that requires prior knowledge to understand what the professors' are sayingPhysics and Maths is fine
Although the content of physics is hard to follow without any background.
Chemistry content is fine, but is not really relevant to exam.
Life Science is hard and exam sucks.They are nice tutor but its sooooo bored.Factual summary: Physics and Maths before midterm; chem and bio after midterm.
Non-factual: 6 classes for each component but think about it as one semster in each part. Some parts could be quite easy for people who took sciences in high school (me inclusive), but other parts... well that depends on how much you know *way* beyond the books. Otherwise the content is pretty interesting (provided that you're into sciences.)I'm quite alright with all of them - they are all nice people and none of them made me fall asleep (...) but I'm especially in favor of Prof Chow: he conveyed the necessary messages (along with mountains of info) very passionately - to me that's the most important thing to decide whether I would end up sleeping in class or not.To begin, I am a first year SBM student some basic knowledge of biology and physic. 0 knowledge of Chemistry

There are 4 different part (5 if including the project)

Chemistry - Mostly history, and some basic things like chemical bonds (I didn't take any Chem course in high school but it was acceptable)

Biology - about all kinds of theory like evolution, cell, genetics

Physic- (Hardest part for me) - simple kinetic and potential energy, thermodynamics

Math - (quite fun) - Mostly about proof theorem - also things like binary numbers, Euclidean geometry, Domino theory, etc

Overall, there was quite a lot of content, but it is split into 2 parts with BIo and Chem being first for us, so our midterm was only about this. Our final is only about math and physics.Prof Williams (CHem) - great professor, teach things clearly and was also helpful to give us a review session that basically tells us what to prepare for the mid-term 1 day before the test

Prof King Chow (BIo) - great professor and really fun. He keeps telling us to think deeper than what is given on the ppt, and seem like he love teaching Bio to us

Prof Yan (Math) - great professor, he speak really good English unlike what other people say in other reviews, I was able to follow easily what he teaches me

Prof Foreman (Physic) - dull professor, but is clear about what he teaches, many people just seem to do other things when he teaches

Overall, all the professor is great, they speak fluent and understandable English (maybe because I am a good English speaker)The content of the course is interesting ,math parts really  needs logical thinking.And for life science part ,King Lau tried to make us more creative .King Lau is PASSIONATE,and actually rpofessors really well prepare the lecturesFor me, it is fine .For chemistry and physics, you can get good scores as long as you really reviewed the contents the professors taught in the lectures.The workload is fine for me.You dont need to prepare a lot for math and life science part a lot since the exams need more logical thinking rather than remembering.The course is divided into three parts-- chemistry, life science, physics and mathematics. The materials covered are very special that probably no other courses would cover the same thing ( I guess that's why it's a SSC course). For life science, all the things taught are crazily deep and difficult that I was thinking whether I am taking a graduate course. For Physics, things were easy at first but eventually went quite deep ( like proof of thermodynamics, theory of relativity and quantum mechanics). For math, it covered some special topics like different number systems in the world, the logic in math, etc. Chemistry is the only normal part (here abnormal does not necessarily mean a bad thing, I actually love the Physics part). But the professor tended to focus more on history, that is the historical development of chemistry. Some false theories in the old days would be taught too. I think the course name suits the course very much, it's really about great ideas in science.The instructors had great freedom in teaching (I guess mostly becoz it's a SSC course). Fair teaching for the chemistry professor and he did iPRS. King Chow(head of IPO), who is the life science professor, is a crazy guy, but the kind of crazy that I admire. Really a figure in academia. Apart from teaching life science materials he would also cover some philosophical questions like what defines you and what is right and what is wrong (no clear answer usually for these questions). He made the lesson lively and interactive. Once one guy was late and was bombed with tons of questions(questions that requires no knowledge but a lot of thinking) which made the lesson so fun. He is so impressive. The physics professor is a very good teacher and his presentation was clear and often asked for questions. Fair teaching for the math professor but his notes were kind of messy.Terribly HARD

Yes do not trust that "the course is designed for students with no science background."

It will teach you from the easiest to the hardest (eg. LIFS1XXX ~>4XXX) in only 6 lessons.

Chem is talking about history (memorize+F.4~5 CHEM please)
LIFS (memorize and attend lessons)
PHYS (memorize and attend lessons)
MATHS (if you ain't maths team in Primary/Secondary life, good luck and have fun)

// (course background excerpt)
The course is designed for students with no science background. .... The course is composed of 4 modules covering topics in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. Examples of topics include geometry, quantum physics, forensic chemistry and theory of evolution ....For math part,  it is only some simple calculation and logic.  For chemical part,  it is a introduction and history of chemistry. Without studying chemistry before, i only learned the periodical table after the course.  For physics part,  it is about specific relativity but very simple. For bio,  it's totally introduction to gene.It is fun of king chow teaching,  although i learn no things about biology.  Other professors also good i thinks,  at least they don't have obvious accent problem.Not for those without science background PLEASE

I'm sure what I write here will be a repeat of the other reviews below so I won't go into too much detail. The info you really want is in the workload section.

Maths: Numerical proofs (sums, fibonacci, viviani) geometrical proofs (euclidean/non euclidean)

Chemistry: atomic concepts/theories throughout history, molecular structure, energetics, applications in the environment

Physics: scientific method, astronomy, basic mechanics/energy concepts, newton, relativity, quantum theories

Lifs: GENETICS ! Dna structure, evolution – a lot of debates about different theories used to describe a singular conceptMaths: Yan Min - goes through proofs quite thoroughly but is such a bore

Chemistry: Williams, Ian Duncan – a bit more passionate, explains concepts decently

Physics: Chen, Tian Wen– Boring boring! couldn't make it through 2 hours without procrastinating on something else

Lifs: Chow, King Lau– very passionate about what he teaches and does explain things fairly wellThe content is definitely not for "students with no science background". The content is tough and students who took Science subjects in high school might still struggle.
For the Mathematics module, you have to learn ancient mathematics, postulates and etc which probably is the hardest module of the course.
The Chemistry module is the easiest and you probably have learned it in high school.
For the physics module, you have to learn relativity, thermodynamics and etc. Quiet tough.
For the biology module, you have to read the assigned readings and understand them. The professor will test you on your understanding of the concepts. He doesn't want us to memorize stuff.
Overall, do not take this course if you are a student with no science background as this course can be very challenging.All of the four professors are really nice and they are really passionate about teaching.This course is separated into four different modules, namely Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Life Science. Mathematics and Chemistry modules are assessed during the midterm, while the rest are assessed in final.

Let's start with the teaching materials.
MATHEMATICS:
- Some brief history of maths
- Bases
- Plane geometry, neutral geometry, non-euclidean geometry
- Logic, proof, maths system
- Maths in art (it is kinda an irrelevant topic, as this part is taught when there were some visitors coming possibly from Mainland China, it is more like a demonstration of teaching, and this is even not included in the exam)

CHEMISTRY:
- History of chemistry
- Periodic Table
- Chemical bonds, structures, reactions
- Analytical chemistry (just very briefly because he didn't have enough time to cover)

PHYSICS:
- Energy and entropy (and its application - engine and refrigerator)
- Quantum effects (wave-particle duality and its application)
- Special relativity

LIFE SCIENCE:
- What is biology, how it starts
- Some DNA mechanism

In my opinion, the content in math, physics and life science modules are great.Prof. Yan and Prof. Foreman explained the concepts really clearly so they were great.

Prof. Chow took a philosophical approach on teaching life science, it might be controversial but personally i enjoyed it. He sometimes used some metaphor to explain how evolution/DNA works and I think he did pretty well here.

Prof Williams in the other hand didn't do so well, because he didn't explain deep enough in some of the concepts. I think it's alright for those who took chemistry before, but for those who didn't, it might be painful.As stated in the title, the content should be easy for anyone who has science background, but fairly difficult to those who don't.

Course is divided into 4 modules, physics, mathematics, chemistry and life science. The course is generally about the important breakthroughs in the 4 fields (e.g. quantum revolution in physics, the development of euclidean geometry in maths, the development of the periodic table in chemistry, the discovery of DNA's structure in life science).

The topics are somewhat related to high school science studies, but they are all taken one step further. The professors also talked about the social impacts of the breakthroughs. To sum up, the course consists of about 60% science history and 40% science. Personally I enjoyed the topics a lot.Don't recommend skipping lessons (except maybe Chemistry lessons) because they are all interesting and informational.

I especially enjoyed Prof. Loy's and Prof. Chow's lessons. Prof. Loy speaks a bit slower but he explains things very clearly. Prof. Chow's classes are interesting and interactive. Make sure you attend his lessons since he gives information that are not included in the lecture notes.Suitable for those who love science or want to explore more about science.
Content of the course is generally interesting, about history and some famous theory the respective field.Prof Chow's teaching is great. He is so engaged in teaching. Always asks us to think and express our ideas.
Prof Foreman: you better not to sit too far away if you want to listen to his teaching since his voice is not that audible.
Other two are ok.In the course you learn 4 modules, Math, Chemistry, Physics, and Life Science.
In all of the modules, they began with shallow things that are easy to understand, then proceed to hard things that are, well, hard.
But the process is too quick for most of the students, and you will need to struggle to understand the deeper concepts.
Having a Chemistry, Physics and/or Biology in your DSE will help you greatly in the contents, but not a must.
For example, I studied Chemistry in DSE and almost 75% of the slides in class can be skipped as I knew them already.Overall, the 4 tutor's teaching are OK
Min Yan: 7.5-8/10, average teaching. (Math module)
Williams Ian Duncan: 6/10, not so good. (Chemistry module)
Foreman Bradley Alan: 7/10, satisfactory. (Physics module)
Chow King Lau: 9/10, a good tutor (Life Science module)There are four subjects - Math Chemistry Physics and Life Science as well as a group project.

Course outline:

Math: History, Geometry, Non-Euclidean Geometry, What is Mathematics, Mathematical World

Chemistry: The Elements, Periodic Table, Chemical Bonds, Chemical Structures, Chemical Reactions, Chemical Fingerprints

Physics: Energy and Entropy, Global Climate Change, Quantum Revolution and its Applications, Einstein's theory of relativity, Space-Time Dilation

Life Science: Definition of the Living World, Definition of Life, Understanding Manipulating Restoring and Creating Life

Project: There will be a list of topics that you can choose from. However, you cannot choose your own teammates and they will be randomly assignedProf YAN: I really like his teaching style and you can see he is really interested in what he is teaching. However, the concepts can get quite difficult at times and you might need some extra time to catch up after class.

Prof WILLIAMS: Classic chemistry professor. Explains the concepts and applications clearly and in detail, but can get a bit boring at times. Answering the PRS questions in his lectures will give you extra points on the chemistry module.

Prof FOREMAN: Likes to have class discussions on difficult topics such as quantum theory to help us understand the ideas better. Classes are quite interesting but his exam was a nightmare.

Prof CHOW: My favorite LIFS professor XD. Great teaching style and is really interested in what he is teaching. Asks questions in class to try and deepen our understanding. Also likes to make interesting examples of vague concepts. And likes to say that getting the Nobel Prize isn't actually that difficult lol.There are 4 modules in the course: Maths, Chem, Phys, Lifs. Each module take 6 lessons.

Maths: Numbers(Numerical systems, Modular Numbers, Bases, Numerical Operations), History(Mathematics of ancient cultures and development of modern mathematics), Geometry(Euclidean geometry, deductive reasoning in geometry, postulates, hyperbolic and elliptic geometry, curvature), nature of Mathematics, Mathematics in arts
(The time is not enough, so Prof. Yan teaches the latter 2 parts very briefly)

Chemistry: Atoms and elements, Periodic Table, Chemical Bonding, Chemical Structures, Chemical Reactions, Chemical Fingerprints(Analytical Chemistry)
The lesson have a significant emphasis on the scienticfic history of these aspects of knowledge

Physics: Basic mechanics, Thermodynamics(1st and 2nd law, energy and entropy, applications), Quantum Mechanics(Particle and waves, Double-slit experiments, Quantum Revolution, Quantum Theories, Applications, Entanglement), Relativity(Luminiferous ether, Special relativity)

Life Science: Meaning of life, Genetics(Genetic codes, associated technologies, mechanisms, historical advancements, applications, related issues, ...), Evolution(Lamarck and Darwin evolution, validity of these evolution theories)Prof. Yan (Maths), Prof. Willams(Chem): Standard teaching, clear explanations and English
Prof. Foreman(Phys): Will try to stimulate discussions on some important issues raised by quantum mechanics(Entanglement) and relativity
Prof. Chow(Lifs): Great teaching, very clear explanations and examples, like asking students questions and stimulating thoughts (You should focus on his teaching, instead of his lecture notes)There are 4 modules in the whole syllabus, PHY, MATH, CHEM, BIO. All of the contents are relatively introductory (if you have studied science before).

I think the whole course is pretty easy if you attend the lessons and really try to understand the topics. However, it could be quite something when you try to master a subject in 3 weeks (3 months 4 subjects = 3 weeks per subject)

Physics focused on wave and relativity; Maths focused on some very conceptual maths and math theories, like how to prove the Euclid Elements and mod; Chemistry focuses on periodic table and the arrangement of electrons and also some history of chemistry; Biology focuses on the meaning of life (a topic that King Chow likes a lot XD) and some basic genetics.

All in all, the contents are more elementary level with some science historical knowledge. I think it is pretty well balanced.All of the professors are very nice people and they really try to make the lessons less boring by inducing some interactions and some small jokes (but not always successful)

All 4 of them have different teaching style but it is quite easy to follow and they are all very willing to answer questions from students. So if you really do not understand a certain topic or concept, be sure to ask them until you grasp the idea (which is very important to the exam)

I remember that my poster topic was on Biology so I sent LOTS of very LONG emails to Professor Chow asking for feedback and opinions, he replied every one of them and answered most of my questions (except those that would directly affect the content of the posters), that really helped me a lot in the poster making process, so just don't be afraid to ask, you may be surprised hahaFour modules in total:

Phys: introduction to basic physics concept, introduction to quantum mechanics, introduction to special relativity. DSE level except introduction to special relativity part (but the math is very simple)
Not much equation need to remember.

Chem: DSE level Chem + a little bit of atomic orbital

Math: History of math, introduction to Euclidean space and Non Euclidean space, a little bit of number theory, introduction to geometric construction.
Focus on concept only, there is only one or two equation need to remember.

Bio: Evolution theory, Genes. etc.
Really focus on concept, the professor even told us if you only remember those specific words (eg. chemical name of DNA) and answer the exam question by only these words, your mark will be deducted.Williams, Ian Duncan: responsible for Chem part. Not much to say, an ordinary professor. If you have already taken DSE level Chem, you can skip most of his lesson
Li Weiping: responsible for Math part. Not much to say, another ordinary professor.
LOY, Michael Ming-tak: responsible for Phys part. Bad teaching, self-study is better than him. Cannot clearly explain physics ideas.
CHOW King Lau: responsible for Bio part. Good professor, especially when explaining Bio concepts. However, his online notes are not sufficient, therefore you better not skip his lesson.phy and bio module learnt a lot of things, know more about science history

math learn more about geometry, but the perspetive part is useless lol

chem.... i skip most lesson, but it is actually not bad, just tired about hlth 1010i would say all four  are good.

michael loy is very professional, willing to answer my question.
king chow is awesome lol
prof li is good at teaching , and want to give A to us lol
dont even know the chem prof, cuz he speak too fast and i know the things already.The course is "designed for students with no science background," but it will be quite difficult for students with no science background. However it would be easy for people who took a lot of science courses.

The course is divided into 4 modules: physics, mathematics, chemistry, and life science. In each module, the professors discuss scientific breakthroughs in each field.

Also, there is a project that you have to do with randomly assigned groupmates (4 including yourself).I don't recommend skipping lessons (especially life science), but it's not a huge deal if you do. The physics and life science professors uploaded their lecture videos.
They're all nice people. All very passionate, too. They will gladly answer students' questions.There were 4 modules: Physics, Maths, Chemistry, and finally Life Science. This course was designed for people who hasn't studied science before, but it didn't check for DSE results like some other courses did.

Physics: half of them are like DSE physics: waves, light, optical fibres etc. And towards the end, there are more difficult things like Theory of relativity which is surprisingly easy to understand (with a DSE physics background)

Mathematics: the infamous rule of The sum of interior triangles < 180 degrees. It's all about ancient mathematics like old Mathematics theories. Doesn't really relate to daily mathematics or MATH1013.

Chemistry: all about DSE chemistry again and something on top of those. But in addition, the professor taught a lot about chemistry history, and the history is tested as well (e.g. who discovered what elements)

Life Science: the professor is more like a Psychology professor in this course. There are technical things that were in the DSE syllabus, but the professor raised a lot of questions about life you have never thought about before.All 4 are nice professors. I enjoy their teaching because I have studied Phys and Chem in DSE. Otherwise it could be a pain.

Could be a bit boring, but what science is interesting.

I had no idea what the maths module professor was teaching at that time, but when I did all his sample questions, I got 100/100 in the math exam, so did almost 1/3 of the class.For biology students, these should be easy.

For non-biology students, these should be manageable.Karl was boring, and we just could not really understand what he is talking about.

Professor Renneberg is much better, we could watch biology related MOVIES during class! And there are questions related to the movies in the exam. Therefore, technically it takes attendance.50% LIFS and 50% CHEM (or actually Biotech)

Prof. Wong gave lectures on the basics of Phy Chem and Bio. Content was alright to me since I have taken Physics and Chemistry in high school. Only four short ppts, and should be manageable for all students.
Prof. Herrup's part: DNA, the nervous system, the immune system and sth related to fertilisation. Only the lecture on DNA was less boring to me .. His ppts are all super long (at least 60 slides per lesson). He told us in the first lecture that he would be gentle to us since most of us aren't science students.. but honestly the content is still too much for non-science students. Indeed struggled quite hard before the midterm exam because of his parts.....
Prof Renneberg is from the Chemistry Dept. His topics included metabolism, proteins and enzymes, infections and high speed of science. Classes are quite interactive and lively.
All three professors' topics are not quite related, but luckily the final isn't cumulative, so you only have to revise Prof. Wong and Prof. Herrup's parts for the midterm (mainly LIFS), and focus on Prof. Renneberg's parts for the Final (CHEM).
Should be pretty easy for science students, but as a business student, the content is simply overloading, esp. for the first half..I was enrolled into the course right before the end of the add-drop period, so I missed 80% of Prof. Wong's lectures. Not much special about this prof.
Prof. Herrup is the head of the LIFS Dept and is super demanding.
Both of them just read out the slides so not much to say about.
Prof. Rennengberg is my favourite among the three. Very funny prof and interesting classes. He prepared movies and other reading materials. He shared his own stories with us and focused on the applications of science, which are much more useful than other prof's lectures.It would be an advantage if you have taken the biology before. Since there are many terms and concepts related. For me I find it boring....Prof. Reinhard RENNEBERG is the most interesting lecturer among three. He prepares a movie and some short clips to demonstrate the content.I found it difficult in both exams since honestly I did not work very hard on it. But outcome the grade was not bad. For two exams I almost below one SD, and finally I got a B-No homework, just a midterm and exam.Topics include:
Cell as the fundamental building block
The molecules of Life
Nucleic acids and genes
DNA: The molecule of heredity
DNA replication and cell division
Protein biosynthesis
Proteins
Diseases caused by genetic disorder
Enzymes
Metabolism
Lipids and carbohydrates
Chemical signaling networks in cells
Tele-communications in the body
Viruses
Chemical interactions in morphogenesis
Our genome
Fighting infections
Fighting cancer
Chemistry and our Environment

The course title is 'Chemistry of Life' but in reality the course is a Biology / Biochemistry course. There is a lot of overlap with LIFS courses such as 1902 (General Biology II) and 2040 (Cell Biology).

The course content is not at all well structured. The 3 professors all teach different topics and they are not integrated, so it keeps switching from one topic to some completely different one.

The level of difficulty is too high for a 1000-level Common Core course meant for students with 'no scientific background'. Because it is mainly a Biology course there is a lot of memorization.The system of 3 professors teaching different topics in the course doesn't work very well for this course because they all teach very different topics, sometimes not related to each other, and all teach in very different styles. Prof. Herrup and Zhu follow a very structured and organized teaching, with clear lecture notes for each of their topics and they usually just explain the slides during the lectures. They both explain the concepts quite clearly and are helpful with any questions.

Prof. Renneberg has a very different style of teaching which students either find very enjoyable or very frustrating. He does not follow any structure whatsoever. He almost never follows the given schedule and teaches any topic at any time. During each lecture also there is no structure as he discusses any topics, stories, jokes, facts, etc. No lecture notes are provided at any time and his content is not directly from any textbook so it's almost impossible to revise his content before the exams. Most of his lectures are spent watching him draw cartoons and watching random Hollywood movies (which are actually tested in the exams with 4 or 5 MCQ questions about the plot of the movies).This course is in general easy. Although it is titled as 'Chemistry and Life', most of the course's materials are biology related (eg. DNA, telecommunications in human bodies, viruses).

For biology part, basically it's about memorisation of different biological processes. Once you get yourself familiar with the details of each process, it should be easy to answer the questions in the exam.

For Chemistry part, you just need to review the concepts Professor Renneberg mentions in class, and his class notes already include everything you will need for the exam.

If you don't really like biology or have zero background about biology, this course is not recommended for you as it could be boring and a bit difficult.Professor Renneberg usually interacts with students in class, like asking questions, sharing his interesting stories and playing course related videos. The other two professors just read out what they have on the powerpoint slides.Although it is called chem and life, but mostly it's about biochem, for example cell structure, DNA, virus, nervous system...
If you have studied Biology before, should be fairly easy for you. Also only enrol it if you have a great interest in the topics mentioned above, otherwise you would find it bored.

Mid-term: 2 papers, 50 marks each
Zhu - all Mc
Renneberg - 8 short questions

Exam: 2 papers, 50 marks each
Peng - MC + short questions
Renneberg - 8 questions including one long question that was about the film

This course is basically about memorising everything that you have learnt.Prof. Renneberg's teaching was actually very good. It was fun and interesting. He likes to use movie to explain some science background, so most of his lecture time, we were watching different films. One thing is that, you must attend his lecture to copy down the notes. His ppt slides were basically pictures, so you would understand nothing simply by looking at them. Also, he would ask about the films that played in lecture in exam n mid-term. For the other profs, they usually just teach whats in the ppt.Course instructors of each discipline (CHEM/ENVS/LIFS/MATH/PHYS) will give an overall introduction of their corresponding disciplines with highlighting the major research areas of the corresponding units and the characteristics of these research areas in terms of content, methodology and latest development, etc. during the lecture.Prof P W Leung and faculty members from Division of Life Science, Departments of Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics, and Environmental Science Programs.
Some professor are really nice and really want to share the experience to you.We had to go to a 1 to 2-hour lecture once every week.

The lectures were delivered by different professors, who would talk about their own research. It could be quite boring if one isn't interested.Not very good as they just read out the lecture slides.
Easily bored if not interested.I can hardly remember what was being taught, but it started with Newton's three laws, and somehow went into gravity, relativity, time dilation, Lorenz transformation (???), and etc... I think my confusion should serve as a warning that unless you're very into theoretical physics, you probably shouldn't take it. (Business student here - only relying on the very little physics and M2 learnt while in high school)Back then it was Prof Ng who taught us (can't pick the name out from the instructor part - has he retired or what???).  He was quite hilarious at times... other than that, admittedly I was trying very hard to understand what he was saying. In general I think he spoke quite clearly, and that should be good.6 compulsory sessions
2 selective sessions
1 personal development plan(it's also a compulsory assignment).Some sessions are really boring but you must attend. So, do what you want to do. For me, I'll......you know.It's very easy to pass. But there still someone who forgot something and failed this course, which leads to taking it again in the next semester.No workload at all. You only need to pay some time to attend the lectures. Remember to bring your smartphone as they will use IPRS to take attendance.Usual students:

Retake students:
2 Selective Activities

1. Induction
2. Anti-telephone deception and Crime Prevention offered by Hong Kong Police Force
3. Meet your Pre-major Faculty Advisor
4. School Co-curricular activities (student sharing)
5. Science Major Week
(Mon-Fri)
6. Know your personality type workshop and Personal Development PlanBoring.
Not really useful except the personality test.

You only see your instructor during Meet your Pre-major Faculty Advisor in fall sem.Not much content, 6 compulsory sections, and 2 selective sections, also a personal development plan and an adjustment survey. The compulsory sections are generally about science school stuff, exchange and other activities organized by science school, and also a personality test which will later be used for the personal development plan. The 2 selective sections are chosen by students from a wide variety of activities by preference.As there are not much content, the teaching is not actually important, mostly throughout the sections you will be informed of the info provided if you pay a little bit attention.For BIBU students.

Meeting with your pre-major faculty advisor & student sharing part may be somewhat useful. But some others are a waste of time.
Their isn't much(or any) relation between "science" and "Anti-telephone deception and Crime Prevention " right? But since it's a attendance-taking course, you must go and listen.Adequate. You can learn some more concerning many aspects.let u know how to choose ur major and plan ur path.
Sometimes are lectures and sometimes are games like a test to clarify ur personality and interests. but u will never know the schedule of this course unless they will notify you through canvas few days before.nice presentation by Tina. She gave lots of example of the students who faced different situation and explain how can we do better.Activities to introduce about SSCI, Major Declaration, Early major declaration,....
Adviser for academic matters, really helpful, mainly for deciding courses (what to take.. and why..)
Pre-major faculty adviser: saw her only once during the compulsory session, I was decided with my major, so no need. You can go and meet the advisers anytime (office hours), they are helpful.The last part of 1st half year was Personal Development Plan, helpful in deciding what you actually want to do.
In the next part, it will be used to help you.
Submit it on time.
The instructions (oral and written) are clear but make sure that you listened carefully to oral ones, confirm it with your friends otherwise)just think the intro is ok ,everyone can digest it,nothing special if u force me to say honestly. Just pay slight attetnion to the class and professor is ok. although some session is boring ,but some time is enjoable to listen the the lecture of professorThe teaching style is similiar to secondary skuOne thing that the course instructor emphasized a lot was that the course did not only teach students what they know, but also what they don't know. It consists of different guest lectures and the content covered was very broad, ranging from particle physics to biology. A timeline was set from the beginning of the universe to the future. Lectures are prepared with content related to a specific point on the timeline, eg: what happened at the very first few seconds of the universe, or ecosystem of the early Earth. The last lecture was a panel discussion on the future of human beings.Almost every lecture you have a different lecturer because most of the classes were guest lectures. Most of the lecturers were fun.Short lectures (1 hour 20 minutes every week) about different topics in science like the formation of the universe, Earth and solar system, emergence of life, evolution, plant biology, human brain, human society, etc.

Very basic introductions to these topics, same as high school science or even lower level of difficulty.

Some topics are interesting, others a bit boring.Different lecturer every week. Some lectures are interesting and funny, but a few are quite boring with too many details like plant biology. It can be a bit confusing because the lectures are not always related to each other so the topics can be a bit random from one week to the next.topic covered:
Where does our universe come from?
Foundation of our physical world (2): Origin of matter and origin of planet Earth
Biodiversity and evolution
Origin of life: Where does life come from?
What guides the human behavior?
The origin of human being
Why are there plants?
What will be the future of our world?interesting and interactive
the prof. are willing to discuss with the students.
the last 20 mins of the lecture will be the discussion sessions
usually some of the classmates may ask the prof. some questions and 20 mins gone and the prof even finish the lecture eariier in order to let us go to a talk
